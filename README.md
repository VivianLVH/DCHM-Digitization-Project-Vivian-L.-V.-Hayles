# DCHM-Repository for my digitization project by Vivian Lopes Valerio Hayles

This repository has been created for my digitization project, which is a requirement for the completion of the course Digitising Cultural Heritage Material at the University of BorÃ¥s. The template used for this project was designed by Wout Dilon, to help the students publish their digitization projects online with GitHub Pages. 

ðŸš€[Visit the Website](https://sslis.github.io/DCHM-template/) if you want to see what the published version of this repository looks like.
