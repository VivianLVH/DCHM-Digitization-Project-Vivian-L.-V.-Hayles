                     <p> 
                        SOMETHING was going to happen at No. 9. That was clear.
<br>The children behind the bars of the high-up nursery windows
<br>across the street could have told the most, I dare say. For one
<br>or two of them had had colds and had not been allowed to go
<br>out for a week or so, and their best amusement had been to
<br>watch the doings of their opposite neighbours. They could have 
<br>told you how the old lady and gentleman had made two or three
<br> short journeys this winter, in spite of the
               cold, staying away a night
                        </p>

<br>or so only, they who for more years than the children certainly
<br>could remember had made but one annual flitting to the seaside
<br>every autumn. And now when a couple of cabs, so loaded with
<br>luggage inside and out that the old gentleman’s valet and the old
<img class="img5" src="assets/img/documents/Images_alone/Image_5.png "width=50% height=50%;">
<br>lady’s maid could scarcely
<br>find room in either, had
<br>driven away from the door
<br>from which a moment be-
<br>fore the neat brougham
<br>had started with the old
<br>people themselves, the child-
<br>ren knew all about it.</p>

<p>"They’ve left for good

<br>a girl, of course jumped to
<br>conclusions much quicker
<br>than Jack, who though he
<br>was older and bigger, la-
<br>boured, poor fellow, under
<br>the disadvantage of being a boy. It wasn't exactly his
<br>fault, to be sure; still he was never allowed to forget it, for
<br>there were three sisters "on the top of him," as Bessie said, and the

<br>two brothers who came "behind her" were too small to be
<br>good for much in the way of backing him up. He was really
<br>"Jack in the middle;" but long ago it had been decided in this
<br>family that there were to be <em>two</em> "Jacks in the middle," even
<br>though it put it all rather crooked. For Bessie and he were so
<br>much nearer each other in age than they were near the big
<br>sisters on the one hand, or the little brothers on the other, that
<br>it would have been absurd to "count ourselves any other way,"
<br>said all of them. And the arrangement was very well carried
<br>out. Jack and Bessie kept together faithfully. They did every-
<br>thing together, even to getting into long division and having the
<br>measles. And this winter they had got bad colds together, which
<br>was rather a good plan, as they could stay in the same room, and
<br>have the same hot gruel at night and the same medicine marked
<br>"three times a day." They were sensible children, you see. I
<br>call it very sensible to have chosen the very time for their
<br>bad colds when there was a removal going on at No. 9
<br>opposite.</p>

<br>we’ll never see them again? In a day or two, you’ll see, there'll
<br>come two or three great big vans and a lot of men, and all the
<br>furniture’ll be carried out and packed into the vans and there’ll
<br>be 'A house to let' opposite, Jack.”</p>
<div id="myDIV"><p>Jack listened admiringly. Bessie was only seven, and he was
<br>eight and a half. He felt that she was far forwarder for her age
<br>than he. But he was a nice boy—he didn’t feel jealous—it was
<br>only fair for girls to have <em>something</em> better than boys, for it must
<br>be very sad never to be able to look forward to having Eton
<br>jackets and trousers, or boots with nails in, or football flannels
<br>like their big cousin D’Arcy. From which you will see that all
<br>the wholesome snubbing of Flora and Pleasance and Agnes had
<br>fallen on rather stony ground. Jack wouldn’t have <em>not</em> been a
<br>boy, not for—oh, I can’t find any strong enough words to
<br>say for it!<br></p> </div>
<div id="myDIV"><p>"I hope it won’t be 'A

<br>was all carried out and the street was left very messy-looking in
<br>front of No. 9 for a day or two, with bits of straw and paper
<br>and ends of string fluttering about. The last person to come out
<br>was the old gentleman and lady’s old cook, who had stayed
<br>behind to see that all was right. She wasn’t going to be their
<br>cook any more, for she was getting too old. And she wiped her
<br>eyes rather sadly as she shut-to the area gate for the last time,
<br>and out of the covered basket which she carried on her arm
<br>there came a plaintive mew of sympathy, for the old cook was
<br>taking the old lady’s old cat away with her.

                    <div id="myDIV"><p>"She’ll be company for you," the old lady had said kindly,

<br>round the kitchen, dear things. How often they have wished to

<p>tour. The pastry cupboard was empty; of the jars of dripping
<br>there remained but one, containing but a mere smearing; the sugar
<br>canister had bodily disappeared! Papa and Mamma Bright-eyes
<br>looked rather blank.</p>
<div id="myDIV"><p>"What a mean revenge!" they said to each other.</p>
<p>The young Bright-eyes were not disconcerted. They found plenty
<br>to amuse them—it was great fun to rush about the kitchen, and in
<br>their ignorance they did not perceive the bareness of the land.
<br>There were still crumbs here and there and some small fragments
<br>of cheese not to be despised, though their Papa looked down upon
<br>it as most plebeian food for mice of quality. And he was too 
<br>shocked and startled by the state of things to rebuke them for
<br>eating anything they found.</p>
<p>"Take comfort, my love," said his wife. "We are still a long
<br>way from starvation. There is a good deal of sawdust and bran in
<br>the wine-cellar, there are some remains of candle-ends in the kitchen
<br>dresser, and even the scraps of oilcloth about the passages are not to
<br>be despised in case of necessity."</p>
<p>But Papa Bright-eyes nearly fainted at her words. I am afraid
<br>he was something of a gourmand.</p>

<br>spite would have gone so far? Could one have believed in such
<br>ingenuity of cruelty? The nameless one has left us, it is

<br>best of sawdust and oilcloth, and even a nibble at wall-paper now
<br>and then, than risk coming across any of that lot, I must say."</p> 
<p>But as a week or two passed, and the last scraps of cheese had
<br>disappeared, and mouldy bran grew rather monotonous fare, even
<br>Mamma Bright-eyes began to urge upon her husband the desirability
<br>of a voyage of discovery into one of the neighbouring houses which
<br>were not to let. And there is no knowing what the unfortunate
<br>family might not have been driven to, had not an unexpected
<br>event happened.</p>
<p>Till now the house had been left empty. The old gentleman
<br>and lady were in some ways a little too economically inclined, and
<br>they had felt so sure of finding tenants or purchasers at once that
<br>they had not thought it necessary to put in a caretaker. But it was a
<br>bad season for letting or selling houses, and at last their agent persuaded
<br>them to put some one in charge who could "keep the dust down" and

<br>shyness, stopped short at sight of the little maiden and looked at her
<br>inquiringly. The nurses and the two little brothers were some way
<br>down the street, coming along more slowly. A smile came over
<br>the rosy face, and to Bessie this smile was irresistible.</p>
               <p>"Are you—have you come to live here?" she added.</p>
               <p>"Please'm, yes'm," replied the child promptly. "Mother and

<br>in this 'ere street," she burst out enthusiastically, "but as how I

<br>charing—just permiscous-like, you see."</p>
               <p>"Are you very dull alone ?" asked Bessie sympathizingly. She
<br>could not by any means understand all that the child said, but this
<br>question seemed safe ground.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, no, Miss. It's a lovely house—it is a pleasure to
<br>sweep the rooms. And there's mice, Miss, as'd make you die with
<br>laughing. They seem half starved, they're so uncommon hungry.
<br>They'll eat the crumbs and we as close as close. I never did see

<br>Mary's my proper name.?"</p>
               <p>"Sleener-mary, what a queer name! I like Poppy better. We'll
<br>call you Poppy," said Bessie, as she and Jack ran off.

            <br><p>HEN Poppy had had air enough<br> and staring up and down the street
<br>enough, she retired into the kitchen.
<br>It was dinner time by now. She
<br>got out a plate with a bit of
<br>cold boiled bacon, and managed
<br>cleverly enough, by the aid of
<br>a shovel, to warm up a roast
<br>potato over from last night's
<br>supper. And then she sat down to
<br>enjoy this unusually good dinner, as
<br>happy as a queen. Had she not
<br>every reason to be happy? No
<br>
<br>more question of rent—a nice bit of fire, a good dinner,mother's

<p>remembered by little Poppy but as in a dream, when "father"
<br>was alive and earning good wages.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>The smell of the bacon and hot potato skin reached other
<br>nostrils besides Poppy's. Father Bright-eyes was on the watch.
<br>Things had been coming to a very bad pass with him and his
<br>family the last few days, and hunger makes brave. Besides,
<br>Poppy was far less alarming than a certain not-to-be-named
<br>personage. As she slowly finished the last scraps of her dinner,
<br>a slight, very slight sound behind her made her look round,
<br>and the long tail of Papa Bright-eyes caught her glance ere
<br>he whisked it after him down the hole in the corner of the
<br>cupboard.</p>
               <p>"Ah, there you are, mousey," said the little girl, "don’t be
<br>afraid, poor dear. I'm not a-going to hurt you. And I've left
<br>some nice crumbs of potato skin and a bit of bacon rind for you.
<br>See there, I'll put it down in front of the 'earth, so as you can
<br>be nice and warm while you eats it. And I'm just a-going to
<br>take a nap, so I'll not even see as you're there. You've no call
<br>to be afraid—go and fetch all the family if you please. We've
<br>no cat—mother and me, we don't hold with cats."</p>
               <p>Then Poppy curled herself up in mother's big old arm-chair,
<br>the one comfortable piece of furniture they possessed, and pre-

<p>comfortably close to the fire where Poppy had placed the crumbs.
<br>It was long since he had had so good a meal, but he would
<br>not keep it all for himself. Back to the cupboard he flitted,
<br>returning in a moment with Mrs. Bright-eyes and the four
<br>small ones. There was not very much dinner for them after
<br>all, but what there was tasted very good, and not the tiniest
<br>crumb was left when they had finished.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>All this time Poppy was peeping at them through her fingers,

               <p>"One, two, three, four," she counted, "oh what fun! <em>Six</em>
<br>little mice. My! mustn't they just be hungry to come out so
<br>bold—poor little mice. I wish I'd more to give you. I'll try
<br>and save a scrap or two of my supper. Wouldn't the young

<br>does flash about! I wonder if they won't get to know me
<br>quite well once they sees I'm not a-going to hurt 'em."</p>
               <p>She moved her foot a very little, just to try. In an instant,
<br>as if by magic, the whole six had disappeared—Poppy could
<br>almost have fancied it a dream that they had been there at all!</p>
               <p>She went up the area steps again when she had "washed

<br>was the hearth to sweep up however, and a lump of coal to
<br>be carefully placed so that it would last till mother came in,
<br>and tea had to be got ready; so Poppy felt herself quite a
<br>housekeeper. She glanced at the opposite house, but there were
<br>no faces at the nursery window; for just then Jack and Bessie
<br>were more profitably occupied in discussing their dinner. So
<br>Poppy got out her knitting when she came in again, and
<br>settled herself in the big arm-chair, wondering how many rounds
<br>of her stocking she would be able to get done before mother
<br>came home. And then a queer thing happened. A very, <em>very</em>
<br>soft sound made her look, not up, but down, for the sound
<br>came from below. There, just where her feet would have
<br>come to had her legs been longer, stood a mouse—a very small
<br>one, with a slight twist at the end of his long tail. He lifted
<br>his two front paws much as a squirrel does when he is holding

WHEN Jack and
<br>Bessie came into
<br>the day-nursery for their
<br>breakfast the next morn-
<br>ing they ran to the
<br>window to look out.
<br>Yes, there at the top of
<br>the area steps, looking
<br>up and down the street,
<br>just like the day before,
<br>stood Poppy. It was a
<br>bright morning, though
<br>rather chilly — the sun
<br>was in Poppy’s eyes,
<br>and she did not see the
<br>two faces pressed against

<p>a tinkling sort of knocking made her look up. Jack was drumming
<br>on the glass with a tin trumpet. Then Poppy’s face broke out in
<br>smiles. She nodded and they nodded. Next a sudden idea struck
<br>her. She held out all the fingers of one hand and the fore-
<br>finger of the other, bobbing them down in turns to show she
<br>was counting.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"One, two, three, four, five, six," she said aloud, as if her voice
<br>could possibly have reached them.</p>
               <p>"What can she mean ?" said Bessie, "she keeps counting up to
<br>six, do you see, Jack? I'll try to make her understand that we'll
<br>talk to her again when we go out." And a series of very funny
<br>signs and pointings ensued, which unfortunatelv Poppy could <em>not</em>
<br>understand at all.</p>
               <p>But she kept her eye on the opposite house all the morning,
<br>and she was at her post when at last the door opened and the two
<br>children ran out. The nurses were getting the little ones down
<br>stairs and there was always some delay with the perambulator, so
<br>Jack and Bessie had time for a word or two.</p>
               <p>"What <em>were</em> you counting on your fingers this morning, Poppy?"
<br>asked Bessie.</p>

               <p>"It were the mice, Miss. You would have laughed. There's

<div id="myDIV"><p>"Oh, Miss, don't you laugh at me now, but p'r'aps I were
<br>dreaming. All the same I promised," and she related Flip's visit
<br>the evening before.</p>
               <p>Jack and Bessie were delighted. They would have stayed
<br>talking to Poppy for some time longer, had not a bumping,
<br>jerking sound across the street announced the exit of the per-
<br>ambulator. So off they flew. But Poppy's communications
<br>gave them plenty to chatter about to each other that morning.
<br><em>Was</em> it a dream, or could it be that mice could <em>sometimes</em> speak?</p>
               <p>From this time forward not many days passed on which they did
<br>not manage to have a little conversation with Poppy. Their nurse
<br>noticed her standing at the gate once or twice but without paying
<br>particular attention, and as the child bobbed a courtesy and a pleasant
<br>good morning, she was quite satisfied when Bessie spoke of her as
<br>"the caretaker's little girl opposite." Not that Jack and Bessie had
<br>the least idea of concealing their acquaintance with Poppy. If any
<br>one had asked about it they would have told all there was to tell,
<br>but no one happened to do so. Their mother was even more busy
<br>than usual just then, as the big sisters were without a governess, and
<br>she had herself to help them in preparing their lessons for their
<br>various masters.</p></div>

<div id="myDIV"><p>Poppy's mother seemed to be in great request just then. "It
<br>never rains but it pours," says the proverb, and now that she was
<br>living rent free she had more "charing" than during all the
<br>past hard winter. When she came home in the evening she
<br>was often too tired to tell her little daughter the stories that
<br>had always been the child's favourites—of "when poor father
<br>was alive and we lived in the country." "The country" was
<br>Poppy's fairyland; she had never seen it that she could re-
<br>member, she tried to picture it to herself from her mother's
<br>descriptions, to be sure, but still, as the good woman told her,
<br>"no words could give the <em>feel</em> of it." And they used to build
<br>castles in the air together of a day when they should have
<br>saved enough to go for some hours by one of the cheap excursions
<br>they saw posters about at the railway stations, "right into the
<br>real country."</p>
               <p>But lately the story-telling had been on Poppy's side much more
<br>than on her mother's. The poor woman was often so tired now
<br>that she liked better to listen than to talk, and Poppy was very
<br>pleased to retail all her conversations with Jack and Bessie, and she
<br>was also very fond of chattering to her mother about Flip and his
<br>brothers and sisters.</p></div>

<br>nothing stirring when you're out. And I do believe as the little one
<br>with the twisty tail as I was telling you of, is getting to know me.
<br>I always put some crumbs for 'em at the same place, and now they'll
<br>come close to my foot."</p>
               <p>"I can’t say as I’m partial to mice," said Poppy's mother. "Still,
<br>I don't suppose they can do much harm here in this empty house.
<br>If I thought they were mischievous, Poppy, I'd have to get a
<br>cat."</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother," almost screamed Poppy, "you'd never go for to
<br>do that! They'll do no mischief—you may be sure. Flip
<br>promised—you remember, mother, I told you. And if it was a
<br>dream, there's dreams as is true. Oh, mother,, you'll never get
<br>a cat."</p>
               <p>Poppy looked ready to cry. But her mother comforted her by
<br>saying she had no wish to get a cat; "cats was great worries, and
<br>took a deal of milk," there was no need for Poppy to work
<br>herself up.</p>
               <p>Some one else was very glad to hear what Poppy's mother said.
<br>Father Bright-eyes was peeping out of the cupboard, listening.

<div id="myDIV"><p>"Certainly not, in <em>my</em> humble opinion," put in Flip, with a
<br>jerk of his distinguished tail. "I am really in a position to
<br>advise you, my dear father, from my intimacy with our bene-
<br>factress, Poppy. So long as we conduct ourselves as well-
<br>bred mice always prefer to do, we have no reason for
<br>uneasiness."</p>
               <p>Father Bright-eyes looked at his eldest son admiringly.</p> 
               <p>"How he expresses himself," he thought. "He is really a
<br>mouse any parents might be proud of. Take him altogether—
<br>the twist in his tail is of course a great natural advantage—but
<br>take him altogether we have not done so badly by him, my dear,"
<br>he observed to Mrs. Bright-eyes, when sure that Flip was out
<br>of hearing. For he was far too sensible, of course, to praise
<br>him to his face. "I am not at all surprised that Poppy, as
<br>he calls her, should have taken him under her special protection."</p> 
               <p>The spring was coming on by now. Already some baskets of
<br>primroses had found their way down the street where Jack and
<br>Bessie and Poppy lived, and one day when, as usual, the opposite
<br>neighbours were having a little talk while waiting for the
<br>perambulator, Jack stuffed a tiny bunch of violets into the small
<br>caretaker's hands.</p></div>

<br>so closely how others—children of their own age—have to "do

<br>who happened to be at home,
<br>had a visitor—a visitor so gentle
<br>and friendly and sympathizing that
<br>her whole simple story, from the old
<br>days of "when father was alive and
<br>we lived in the country" to the present
<br>good-luck of "a winter rent-free," was soon
<br>told. And Poppy's--that is to say "Sleena
<br>Mary's" — small womanly ways and funny fancies, brought
<br>smiles to the visitor's face.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"Never was such a child for amusin' of herself," said the mother.

               <div id="myDIV"><p>"It seems a nice house," said the children's mother, "and you

               <p>"It's nice and clean all over. The old people as lived here was
<br>very pertickler, and Poppy's always a-keeping down the dust," said
<br>the caretaker with pride. And she was very proud to show the lady
<br>through the rooms.</p>
               <p>"It is a very nice house," she repeated as she went. And to
<br>herself she added— "I think it would be the very thing for <em>them</em> if
<br>they decide upon taking a house, and it would be nice to have them
<br>so near." The long-looked-for birthday fell on a Wednesday.
<br>People are fond of saying that things very seldom turn out as we
<br>wish them in this world, and perhaps in some ways this is true.
<br>Still I have noticed that sometimes, and especially when really good
<br>and kind and nice wishes are concerned, things do often turn out very
<br>right indeed. That was the case this time. Though only April, the
<br>most fickle of months, the day was lovely, quite lovely; the sort of day
<br>on which you could <em>feel</em> that the birds and the flowers and the squirrels
<br>and the rabbits, with thoughts of which little Poppy's head was
<br>stuffed full, must be all enjoying themselves thoroughly. And never

               <div id="myDIV"><p>An hour and a half brought the travellers to their journey's end.
<br>By this time Poppy was almost speechless with delight. The first
<br>real green fields and woods had been met by her with cries of pleasure,
<br>but when, as they went further, the country grew still prettier, and
<br>here and there on the banks the yellow primroses smiled up in
<br>welcome and the birds flitted about in the sunshine, she grew silent.</p>
               <p>"Don’t you like it, Poppy ?" asked Bessie.</p>
               <p>"Bless you, missy, I should rather think I did. I've no more
<br>words to say—that's what it is," she answered.</p>
               <p>She found her tongue again however when they had got out of
<br>the train and were walking through the lanes with the cousin who
<br>had come to meet them with her nurse.</p>
               <p>"Shall we go home by the lane and the fields?" asked Delia.
<br>"Won't Poppy like it better than the road?"</p>
               <p>For the Jacks-in-the-middles' Mamma had written all about
<br>Poppy, and Delia meant to join her cousins in making the little
<br>caretaker's first day in the country as happy as possible.</p>
               <p>"Of course she would, and so would we," said Bessie. "It’s such
<br>fun climbing stiles after you've been a good long while in London."</p></div>

<br>for auntie," said Delia. "She wrote that she wanted a lot for
<br>a dinner-party. Mamma will lend us her nice flat flower-baskets
<br>—we line them with damp moss and it keeps the flowers so much
<br>fresher than when they're all on the top of each other in deep
<br>baskets. If only it was warmer we might have had tea in the
<br>wood."</p>
               <p>"Tea in the wood," repeated Poppy, in amazement.</p>
               <p>Then they had to explain to her all about gipsy teas and picnics,

               <p>The whole day was to her a dream of delight, and I am quite
<br>sure that the sight of her pleasure had a good deal to do with
<br>Jack's and Bessie's conviction that this was the happiest birthday
<br>they had ever had.</p>
               <p>They were all at the primrose gathering when they arrived

<h3>A MOUSE CONCLAVE.</h3>
                     
                    
<p>The happy day came to an end at
<br>last, as all days both happy and
<br>sad do. But in one way it did
<br>not come to an end:
<br>indeed its pleasure lasted
<br>on for a good many
<br>other days to come, for Poppy
<br>especially — the telling mother all
<br>about it was so delightful.</p>
<br>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>And another pair of ears besides
<br>mother's took it in too. Flip was there,
<br>in a corner of the kitchen where no
<br>one saw him, listening eagerly. He
<br>had missed Poppy the day before, and a
<br>great deal of curiosity had been felt by all the Bright-eyes family
<br>as to what had become of her, and Flip had run out into the

<p>kitchen extra early that morning to find out if she had come back
<br>again.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>No, Poppy was not there, only her mother who seemed very
<br>busy cooking something—<em>was</em> she cooking? thought Flip—on the
<br>dresser. It must be something very nice, surely; she had such a
<br>pleased smile on her thin face. He waited till she went into the
<br>next room, a nice airy room behind the kitchen where she and
<br>her little daughter slept, and then like a flash of lightning he was
<br>up on the top of the dresser, peering about with his gleaming black
<br>eyes, snuffing about with his sharp little nose, in search of the
<br>wonderful dish which had so absorbed the caretaker's attention.
<br>There was nothing to smell, <em>almost</em> nothing at least, only a faint,
<br>fresh perfume which Flip had never come in contact with before,
<br>and to <em>see</em>, why what was that? A round flat dish, an old
<br>soup-plate in fact, filled almost to the outside edge with pale
<br>yellow blossoms, bordered by soft green leaves, which Poppy's
<br>mother had carefully set round them as a frame. Flip did not
<br>call them blossoms and leaves; poor Flip, in spite of his ances-
<br>tral tail and his cleverness, he was only a town mouse, he had
<br>never seen the fields and the hedges and had no wish to
<br>do so!</p></div>

<br>almost no scent, and I don't <em>think</em> they can be good to eat."</p>
               <p>He was stepping cautiously along the edge, for he was sharp
<br>enough to descry water not far off.</p>
               <p>"Let's see," and he nibbled one delicate petal. "Faugh! Horrid,

<br>tasteless stuff, what in the world was the silly old woman looking so

               <p>Just then Poppy and her mother came into the kitchen; Flip
<br>hastily decamped to a shady corner, but not before the caretaker
<br>had caught sight of his tail.</p>

<div id="myDIV"><p>"Oh don't touch him, mother," cried the little girl anxiously,
<br>not that there was any fear truly of the caretaker's being able to
<br>do so! "It's Flip, I'm sure; I dare say he knows I've been in
<br>the country. I'm not sure if I told him, but he may have heard
<br>us talking about it."</p>
               <p>Flip smiled to himself in his corner, and decided to stay and hear
<br>more. But Poppy's mother looked at her rather anxiously: the
<br>little girl was rubbing her eyes and her rosy face looked drowsy
<br>though smiling.</p>
               <p>"My deary, you've not had your sleep out, you’re dreaming still,"
<br>she said.</p>
               <p>Poppy shook her head.</p>
               <p>"No, I'm not indeed," she said. But seeing that her mother
<br>seemed uneasy, she said no more about Flip and his family. "Shall
<br>I go on telling you about it all yesterday, mother dear?" she said. 
<br>"You like that better than my mouse stories, don't you? But
<br>there's mice in the country too, did you know that? just as there
<br>is children in the town and children in the country, you know,
<br>mother. It do seem quite natural-like, don't it ?"</p>
               <p>"Field-mice is not quite the same kind, I don't think," said her
<br>mother. "And children is children all the world over, I take it."</p></div>

<div id="myDIV"><p>"No, no, mother, you're wrong there," said Poppy brightly,
<br>"and I can prove it you. Many a time you've said to me I was
<br>more like a country-child than a town-child, 'cos of my rosy cheeks.
<br>There now, mother."</p>
               <p>They had a laugh over this, and then Poppy went on with her
<br>glowing account of all she had seen and done the day before,
<br>finishing up with the old wish.</p>
               <p>"Oh, mother, if we could but go and live in the country like we
<br>used to when I was a baby!"</p>
               <p>And Flip listened too, with all his ears.</p>
               <p>There was a great discussion that evening in the nest of the
<br>Bright-eyes family. It is at night, as perhaps you know, that mice
<br>are at their best and sharpest, so all questions of importance among
<br>them are talked over when we, tail-less, two-legged beings are
<br>asleep and dreaming, and Flip waited till night to tell his father
<br>and mother and brothers and sisters of all the wonderful things
<br>he had been hearing, and to propose that they should all as a family
<br>emigrate to the country.</p>
               <p>But Papa shook his head. He thought his son very sharp and
<br>clever, but still—"there is a very great deal to consider and inquire
<br>about," he said, "a very great deal. First and foremost what about,"

<br>and cousins, and these country cousins were but distant con-

<br>greatly to our advantage it might be to emigrate, what of our bene-

<p>OPPY was sitting alone in the kitchen
<br>next afternoon—that is to say the
<br>afternoon but one after the birthday treat
<br>-at her knitting as usual. Her mother
<br>was out, but she had promised to
<br>be home by tea-time.</p>
              <div id="myDIV"><p>"I wish she would come," thought
<br>the little girl. "I've several more
<br>things to tell her that I'd for-
<br>gotten. How nice it would be to
<br>be living somewhere where mother
<br>didn't need to go out all day and
<br>leave me alone; I'll be glad to go
<br>back to school again," and she gave a little sigh. "I wonder

<br>they'd come over to see me soon, but of course they've got their

<br>mother says, for me to put myself for'ard too much, though
<br>they've been so wonderful good to me,"</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>She was feeling a little dull after the great excitement of the
<br>birthday treat, and perhaps she was still rather tired with the rail-
<br>way and the exercise in the fresh air, all so unusual in her quiet
<br>life. The knitting-needles dropped from her hands, her little
<br>round head fell back against the rail of the high, old-fashioned
<br>rocking-chair, and Poppy was fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Suddenly—she sat straight up with a start—something had touched
<br>her foot, nay, something was moving right up her leg and—lo!
<br>and behold—a pair of bright eyes were staring up in her face.
<br>Flip, tail and all, was sitting on her knee! For half an instant
<br>Poppy felt inclined to scream. Even if one is on very friendly terms
<br>with mice one doesn't <em>quite</em> like to feel them running over one.
<br>But before she had time to get her breath for even the tiniest cry,
<br>a little voice stopped her.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, dear Poppy, I beg of you," it said. "I would
<br>not have taken such a liberty as to run up your leg, had not
<br>all other means of attracting your attention failed."</p>
               <p>"Dear me," thought Poppy, "how very grandly he talks!
<br>I wonder if he goes to school now and learns all those long words

               <div id="myDIV"><p>"Never mind," she replied. "I didn't like it much when I
<br>felt you on my legs, but if you'll sit still now and not flop about
<br>your long tail I dare say I'll get used to you. Why haven't
<br>you been to see me for so long—though

<br>to be sure," she added, with considerable
<br>pride, "I've been away—you didn't know,
<br>did you, that I'd been in the country—ever
<br>so far?"</p>
               <p>Flip gave a superior smile,
<br>but I am afraid it was lost
<br>on Poppy. It takes a
<br>good deal of education to
<br>see when a mouse is smiling.</p>
               <p>"Oh dear, yes," he said,
<br>"I know all about it. I
<br>ventured to listen to all
<br>you were telling your

<p>tell you about it, that was why I intruded this afternoon—we had
<br>a very serious discussion last night as to whether we, the Bright-
<br>eyes family, might not do well to emigrate ourselves to the country.
<br>Hearing of our cousins still being there made us feel we should
<br>not be without friends; and there seem to be other advantages.
<br>You—you do not appear to have come across any member of the

<br>and speaking rather nervously.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>Poppy did not immediately reply.</p>
               <p>"I'd really like to put him down a little," she said to herself,

<br>fields and hedges, where it's pretty cold very often I dare say,

<br>We decided against it. I proposed and it was unanimously agreed

<h3>BAD NEWS.</h3>

                     
<p>DAY or two after Poppy's conversation
<br>with Flip, there came a particularly bright
<br>and sunny morning. Such mornings, in
<br>London especially, are rare in early spring-
<br>time.</p>
               <p>"It does one good to see the sun
<br>shining so," said the caretaker, as she
<br>set off on a day's charing. "You
<br>might bring your work and sit on
<br>the top of the area steps a bit,
<br>Poppy, if you put your little shawl
<br>on, after you've tidied up."</p>
              <div id="myDIV"><p>"Yes, mother, and may be I'll
<br>see Master Jack and Miss Bessie if they
<br>pass. Such a fine morning they're pretty sure to be goin' out a

<p>and her knitting needles were comfortably settled on the top
<br>step, the door of the house opposite opened and the usual little
<br>party sallied forth. Jack and Bessie were across the street in
<br>an instant.</p>
   <div id="myDIV"><p>"Good morning, Poppy," they both exclaimed. "We've been
<br>so wanting to see you. Were you very tired the day after our
<br>birthday?"</p>
               <p>"I was a bit sleepy," Poppy answered, her round face broadening
<br>out into a smile, "but what did that matter? Oh, Miss Bessie,
<br>but it was a beautiful day! I'll never forget it—no, never. I've
<br>been wantin' dreadful to see you to tell you again how I did enjoy it!"</p>
               <p>"I <em>am</em> so glad you did," exclaimed Bessie, and Jack joined in
<br>of course.</p>
               <p>"You'll have some more treats like it some day p'r'aps," said he in
<br>his slow way. He was not near so quick as Bessie, though he was
<br>a year older. "When we go to the country—we always do, you
<br>know, about July or August, isn't it, Bessie?—we're going to ask
<br>Mamma for you to come there, aren't we, Bessie?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, I do hope it'll be in my holidays," said Poppy, clasping
<br>her hands together."(sic) Do you think it will, miss? For I'm goin'
<br>to school again now reg'lar. I'm to begin on Monday."</p>

<p>for her, but if she's to be in on Monday, there's no need to
<br>explain. It'll be all right."—"The child wouldn't understand,
<br>the ladies will tell her mother themselves," thought the nurse
<br>to herself, in which she made a mistake, not knowing how very
<br>"understanding" Poppy was. And this mistake of hers caused
<br>a good deal of sorrow that might have been avoided.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>Then the children bade their little friend good-bye and went
<br>on for their walk, leaving her with new fancies out of which
<br>to spin pleasant day-dreams.</p>

<br>"Oh, I do hope it'll be in my holidays. I'll work my best at school,
<br>that I will, so as I'll deserve a treat if it comes, as mother
<br>says."</p>
               <p>And full of these good resolutions, the little maiden set off for
<br>school on Monday morning. She was a favourite there, for she
<br>was both quick and willing, and she was pleased to find herself
<br>put back in her former place, even though she had been three
<br>months absent.</p>
               <p>"You were well on for your age before you were away,

<p>to tell, so that for a moment or two, Poppy did not notice that she
<br>was pale and her eyes rather red, as if she had been crying a
<br>little. But as soon as she did see it she flew to her mother and
<br>kissed her.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"Is there anything the matter? Are you ill, dear mother?"
<br>she asked anxiously.</p>
               <p>"No, no, deary," said the poor woman, trying to smile and
<br>checking back the tears, "it's downright ongrateful of me, it is,
<br>to make a trouble of what was bound to come. I should be
<br>thankful for the good its done us, you 'specially, Poppy. You're
<br>not to say the same child as when we came here, and—"</p> 
               <p>Poppy's rosy face grew pale too.</p>
               <p>"I know," she said, "the house is took."</p>
               <p>Her mother answered more brightly,</p> 
               <p>"Not to say <em>took</em>, but it looks like it," she said. "But, Poppy
<br>love, we mustn't make a trouble of it, we mustn't indeed. There's
<br>been some ladies to look at it, and by all I could hear they liked
<br>it very much and said it seemed just the thing. They were
<br>very civil to me and give me a shilling for my trouble—real ladies
<br>they was. But of course I couldn't have axed no questions as to
<br>when it'd be for, and such-like. We'll just have to cheer-up and
<br>make the best of it. I'll step round to the agent's in a few days,

<br>thing was heard by Poppy
<br>and her mother about the
<br>house being taken. They
<br>were almost beginning to
<br>hope that it had been a
<br>false alarm, for "there's
<br>many a slip 'twixt the cup
<br>and the lip," said the caretaker,
<br>who was rather fond of proverbs,
<br>when one morning, just as Poppy
<br>was coming in from school, there appeared a man sent by the
<br>agent to take down the board announcing that the "desirable
<br>residence was to be sold or let."</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"And you'll clean off the paper in the front window too, please,"

               <p>"Certainly it is," he replied, "and a good job too for the owners."</p>
               <p>"To be sure," she said, trying to smile, "what's one man's
<br>meat is another man's poison," which the agent thought rather a
<br>good joke.</p>
               <p>"You don't know as your gentleman is in want of a caretaker
<br>for any other house, do you?" she said timidly.</p>
               <p>"Can't say, I'm sure. But there's houses dropping in every
<br>day. T'would do no harm for you to step round and ask for
<br>yourself. And oh, by the by, I was forgetting I was to tell you
<br>you needn't turn out till you hear more. The party that's taken the
<br>house might want you to stay on a bit when their things begin

               <p>"When are they coming?"</p>
               <p>"They want to be in and settled by the middle of May," he
<br>said. "You'll come in for the cleaning-down, maybe. You see
<br>there's not much painting or papering needed; it's in such
<br>good condition."</p> 
               <p>And with these words he took his departure.</p>
               <p>Considering what he had told her, Poppy's mother thought it

<p>turned up. She had been out on this errand the following Wednesday
<br>afternoon, Poppy's half-holiday, leaving the little girl in charge—
<br>Poppy only thought that her mother had been out shopping
<br>—so as the caretaker came near to number nine on her return,
<br>she was surprised to see the child looking out for her with evident
<br>eagerness.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"Nothing wrong, deary?" she said cheerfully, though with a
<br>little sinking at her heart. Her small "house hunting" on her
<br>own account had not tended to raise her spirits; she minded nothing
<br>for herself, but for Poppy! The few rooms within her means
<br>seemed sadly poor and stuffy; surely the rents had gone up even
<br>in the last few months? "nothing wrong?" she repeated.
<br>Supposing the new owners of the house were coming in at
<br>once, and did not want her at all?</p>
               <p>"No, no, mother, at least I don't think so. The ladies, at least
<br>one of them, has been here; it was quite a young lady; she came
<br>to take a measure for her Mamma she said, and oh! just fancy,
<br>mother, she was Miss Delia's—Miss Delia-in-the-country's big
<br>sister! She's stayin' over the way, and she knowed me—she
<br>said, 'Well, my little girl, and how have you been getting

               <div id="myDIV"><p>Over the way in Jack's and Bessie's home the same subject, little
<br>as Poppy and her mother suspected it, was being talked about.</p>
               <p>"I saw the little girl—I forget her name—the caretaker's little
<br>girl at number nine, Auntie, when I went over there to measure
<br>the drawing-room mantelpiece for mother," said Constance, Delia's

               <p>Her aunt started.</p>
               <p>"Oh, by the by, I meant to have gone over to speak to the
<br>poor woman. I did send a message by Carter to tell her not to
<br>be uneasy. But it was difficult for me to know what to say till
<br>your mother had seen her for herself."</p>
               <p>"But Mamma did see her for herself, the other day you know,
<br>when she came to look over the house," said Constance. "Didn't
<br>she tell her then what we've been thinking of?"</p>
               <p>"No, several things had to be considered first and some inquiries
<br>made. It was only yesterday I heard that your father and mother
<br>had decided to offer her the lodge. I quite meant to have gone
<br>over to speak to her, but I have been so exceedingly busy.

               <p>But the afternoon was already well advanced, and before the

               <p>And all this time Poppy's heart was very sore. She did not

<br>in one corner of the kitchen, which crept towards her when she

               <p>"Flip, Flip," she said, "come and speak to me. Mother's in
<br>the back kitchen washing. "Oh, Flip, have you heard that we're

               <p>"I thought something was the matter," Flip replied. "I—I
<br>could not help hearing some conversation between you and your
<br>mother. It is very distressing, just too when we had given up

<p>"GOOD morning, Mrs.
<br>Orchard." (I don't
<br>think I have ever mentioned
<br>that Poppy's last name was
<br>Orchard, have I? A nice
<br>country-sounding name it
<br>is, isn't it?) "I am so
<br>sorry not to have come over
<br>to see you before, but you
<br>got my nurse's message?"
<br>said Bessie's mother to
<br>Poppy's, the next day when she found herself at last standing at
<br>the door of number nine opposite.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>The caretaker stared.</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am, I don't think I've had any message," she said.
<br>"And if it was given to Poppy, she's a thinkin' kind of child; she
<br>wouldn't go to forget to tell me. She's just in from school, ma'am,
<br>I'll call her. But would you kindly step down to the kitchen,

<br>more than usual, as she led the way to the kitchen, Bessie's mother
<br>following her.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she replied, "it is about that I wanted to speak to you,
<br>and it will take some little time to explain, so we may as well sit
<br>down and talk comfortably. Oh, here is Poppy. How are you, my
<br>dear? Didn't my second nurse give you a message from me for
<br>your mother the other day, Poppy?"</p>
               <p>Poppy considered.</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am," she replied, "she only asked me if mother would
<br>be in on Monday, and I said I knew she would be. Perhaps I
<br>should have told mother, but I never thought of it again."</p>
               <p>"You should 'a told me," said the caretaker.</p>
               <p>"Oh, but that wasn't the message," said the lady. "There must
<br>have been some mistake about it. My message was to tell you,
<br>Mrs. Orchard, that the ladies who were coming to see the house
<br>were relations of ours, and that you mustn't be put out about having
<br>to leave, as we should think of you in making our plans. I
<br>must speak to Carter about it."</p>

               <p>"Certainly," her visitor replied. "I've no doubt my sister would

               <p>Poppy grew quite bright again.</p>
               <p>"That will be nice," she said, "and to be sure it isn't as if mother

               <p>"Why shouldn't they keep a cat, my dear?"</p>

               <p>The lady could not help smiling.</p>
               <p>"Are these your names for them?" she said. "Well, now I come to
<br>think of it, I dare say my friends will not keep a cat, for the girls have
<br>some very favourite birds. But you'd better ask them yourself, Poppy,
<br>when you see them next week, and perhaps you might say a word or
<br>two for your pet mice. If they promise to be very good and not mis-
<br>chievous, and if no other mice come to live at number nine, perhaps my
<br>sister will allow this family to stay here unmolested. There are mice
<br>and mice, you know; some are exceedingly tiresome and mischievous."</p>
               <p>"Ours aren't like that, I'm sure," answered Poppy. "All the

<br>the kind lady to herself.</p>
               <p>And oh, what a joyful afternoon the two had; talking over the
<br>news that seemed almost too good to be true, picturing the little
<br>cottage to themselves, planning what new things they would be able
<br>to buy to make it look pretty and neat. "For we must be a credit

<br>words could she find for these blue and
<br>golden days, with their wealth of flowers
<br>and butterflies, birds singing overhead,
<br>sleepy-eyed cows in the fields, every-
<br>thing, so at least it seemed to her, fresh
<br>and sweet and happy! For it was a

<br>at least, <em>always</em>.</p>

               <p>"Yes—I told teacher so," said Poppy, but she spoke rather

<p>house.'" And Poppy was so happy that she was obliged to hop
<br>all round the kitchen and down the little garden path and back
<br>again, on one foot, to calm down her spirits a little.</p>
               <div id="myDIV"><p>"I wonder," she said presently, when she was sitting at breakfast
<img class="img51" src="assets/img/documents/Images_alone/Image_51.png "width=50% height=60%;">
<br>with her mother, "I wonder if
<br>Miss Delia will bring all her birds
<br>down to the country. And if she
<br>does I do hope the servants at
<br>number nine won't go and get
<br>a cat, mother?"</p>
               <p>Poppy looked quite distressed.</p>
               <p>"There's no fear of their getting
<br>a cat so long as the mice do
<br>no mischief," said her mother.
<br>"There was no talk of it that
<br>time I went up for two nights to
<br>help when the cook was ill.
<br>Indeed the servants were saying
<br>it was a wonderful clear house for mice."</p>
               <p>"I'm so glad. I do so hope Flip and all of them are very
<br>good," said Poppy, as if speaking to herself. "I'll ask Miss Delia
<br>all the same," she added.</p>
               <p>And so she did, the next afternoon, when, as had been settled, the
<br>two girls and Jack came to take tea with Mrs. Orchard and Poppy.</p>

<p>cakes and the jam—and the cream—which Poppy's mother had
<br>bought at the farm for a <em>great</em> treat—how pretty the neat table
<br>looked, with a clean cloth and a beautiful posy of the roses that
<br>grew round the lodge windows, in the middle! And after tea,
<br>when everybody declared they really <em>couldn't</em> eat any more, how
<br>Poppy did enjoy showing the children all over—besides the big
<br>kitchen there was a back one where Mrs. Orchard did all the
<br>cooking, so that the front room was as neat as a new pin always,
<br>and up stairs there was a nice big bedroom and a cosy tiny one
<br>out of it, which was to be Poppy's own when she was a big girl
<br>and able to earn money to furnish it. Then the bit of garden was
<br>a great source of pride, and a tiny wired-in poultry yard where
<br>they could keep a few hens and have fresh eggs to sell and sometimes
<br>to eat—all had to be shown, and the little guests took as much
<br>interest in it as if it were their own.</p>

<br>stories now, Poppy, about the mice, you know? How they must
<br>miss you at number nine!"</p>
               <p>Poppy looked a little troubled.</p>
               <p>"Miss Bessie," she said, "I didn't make up about Flip and
<br>the others. I might—<em>p'r'aps</em> I might have dreamed some of it, but
<br>not all. I'd have told you, I would indeed, if I had made it all up."</p></div>

<br>I was, you see. 'I beg your pardon,' he went on, 'for disturbing you
<br>at this unseasonable hour—' he did use such grand words! — but my
<br>excuse is that I may not have another opportunity. I see you are
<br>all going down to the country—we ourselves have often thought
<br>of taking a trip down there—we have cousins in the country,
<br>but for several reasons we have given up thoughts of it—and no
<br>doubt you will see our dear little friend, Poppy Orchard. May
<br>I ask you to give her my very kindest regards—Flip—Flip Bright-
<br>eyes is my name—and tell her we are all well, wonderfully well,
