                        SOMETHING was going to happen at No. 9. That was clear.
The children behind the bars of the high-up nursery windows
across the street could have told the most, I dare say. For one
or two of them had had colds and had not been allowed to go
out for a week or so, and their best amusement had been to
watch the doings of their opposite neighbours. They could have 
told you how the old lady and gentleman had made two or three
short journeys this winter, in spite of the
               cold, staying away a night<pb/>

or so only, they who for more years than the children certainly
could remember had made but one annual flitting to the seaside
every autumn. And now when a couple of cabs, so loaded with
luggage inside and out that the old gentleman’s valet and the old
lady’s maid could scarcely
find room in either, had
driven away from the door
from which a moment be-
fore the neat brougham
had started with the old
people themselves, the child-
ren knew all about it</p>
                        

<p>
"They’ve left for good
now," said Bessie, who being
a girl, of course jumped to
conclusions much quicker
than Jack, who though he
was older and bigger, la-
boured, poor fellow, under
the disadvantage of being a boy. It wasn't exactly his
fault, to be sure; still he was never allowed to forget it, for
there were three sisters "on the top of him," as Bessie said, and the

two brothers who came "behind her" were too small to be
good for much in the way of backing him up. He was really
"Jack in the middle;" but long ago it had been decided in this
family that there were to be two "Jacks in the middle," even
though it put it all rather crooked. For Bessie and he were so
much nearer each other in age than they were near the big
sisters on the one hand, or the little brothers on the other, that
it would have been absurd to "count ourselves any other way,"
said all of them. And the arrangement was very well carried
out. Jack and Bessie kept together faithfully. They did every-
thing together, even to getting into long division and having the
measles. And this winter they had got bad colds together, which
was rather a good plan, as they could stay in the same room, and
have the same hot gruel at night and the same medicine marked
"three times a day." They were sensible children, you see. I
call it very sensible to have chosen the very time for their
bad colds when there was a removal going on at No. 9
opposite.</p> 
                        <p>For that was the meaning of the unusual journeys and general
excitement, as Bessie had guessed.</p>
<p>"They’ve left for good now," she said. "Poor old lady and
gentleman. It makes me rather sad—doesn’t it you, Jack?—to think

                        we’ll never see them again? In a day or two, you’ll see, there'll
come two or three great big vans and a lot of men, and all the
furniture’ll be carried out and packed into the vans and there’ll
be 'A house to let' opposite, Jack.”</p>
<p>Jack listened admiringly. Bessie was only seven, and he was
eight and a half. He felt that she was far forwarder for her age
than he. But he was a nice boy—he didn’t feel jealous—it was
only fair for girls to have something better than boys, for it must
be very sad never to be able to look forward to having Eton
jackets and trousers, or boots with nails in, or football flannels
like their big cousin D’Arcy. From which you will see that all
the wholesome snubbing of Flora and Pleasance and Agnes had
fallen on rather stony ground. Jack wouldn’t have not been a
boy, not for—oh, I can’t find any strong enough words to
say for it!</p> 
<p>"I hope it won’t be 'A
               house to let' for long," he replied.
"Can’t you guess about that too, Bessie? I should like new
people to come at once, while we’re not doing lessons. It would
be fun to see the furniture all going in, and to watch to see what
they were like."
</p> 
<p>But Bessie wasn’t enough of a gipsy to predict any more. She
was right enough so far—the big vans came and the furniture

was all earned out and the street was left very messy-looking in
front of No. 9 for a day or two, with bits of straw and paper
and ends of string fluttering about. The last person to come out
was the old gentleman and lady’s old cook, who had stayed
behind to see that all was right. She wasn’t going to be their
cook any more, for she was getting too old. And she wiped her
eyes rather sadly as she shut-to the area gate for the last time,
and out of the covered basket which she carried on her arm
there came a plaintive mew of sympathy, for the old cook was
taking the old lady’s old cat away with her.
</p>

                    <p>"She’ll be company for you," the old lady had said kindly,
"and she’d never take to country ways. You must bring her
to see us when you come to spend a day though."</p> 
    <p>For the old gentleman and lady had taken a house some way
out of town. They were getting too stiff for London stairs,
they said, and they wanted a garden to stroll about in.</p>
<p>Jack and Bessie had not been the only—people I was going
to say, but that would not do—ones, I’ll say for the present, to
watch with interest the signs of a removal from No. 9. There
was a whole family even more interested in it than the two
children opposite.</p>

               old cook and the old cat, the excitement of this family reached
its height.</p>
<p>"It’s true, it’s all true—our best hopes are fulfilled. Ah my
poor heart! It is palpitating with emotion. I shall never again be
the—the mouse I was, I fear, my beloved Mrs. Bright-eyes. What
I have gone through of late since our little ones have been old enough
to run about alone, no one knows."</p>

 <p>And Mr. Bright-eyes smoothed his ruffled fur with his paws—
for a mouse’s fur can be rubbed the wrong way, though you
mightn’t think it—and looked up to his plump little wife for
sympathy.</p>

<p>"My poor dear," she said feelingly, "I can’t bear to think of
it. But you speak of good news—can it be—is it possible that
the—the unmentionable one—is gone? Has she over-eaten herself
—has her hideous voice at last worn out some neighbour's patience ?
Why if I were a human being I would not have endured her a
single night! But alas! such good news is not to be hoped 
for.”</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, my love. Our fiendish enemy, the enemy
of our race, is, I may take upon myself to say, still in the land of
the living, but she will never trouble us more. I have just from
a hole in the kitchen cupboard watched her departure—her final

as they left the kitchen, cook looked round and said, 'So it’s
good-bye to the old place at last for you and me, pussy.' At

pussy,’ continued the
deluded creature, 'I
cannot hope for mice
in our new home. For
they are the most de-
structivest and forage-
ousist pests as never
was. They may have
it all their own way

never for all I cares.'
And with that she shut
the door, sending my
poor heart pit-a-pat, and I darted home to tell you. But
the emotion is too much for me. Have you a morsel of some-
thing at hand? I could—I think I could swallow a crumb of

again, and if all is right the children may accompany us on a stroll
round the kitchen, dear things. How often they have wished to

the jars of dripping, the sugar canister! Ah, what sweet

now visit them as often as we choose! This day is a reward
for all our sufferings."</p>

there remained but one, containing but a mere smearing; the sugar
canister had bodily disappeared! Papa and Mamma Bright-eyes
looked rather blank.</p>
 
<p>"What a mean revenge!" they said to each other.
The young Bright-eyes were not disconcerted. They found plenty
to amuse them—it was great fun to rush about the kitchen, and in
their ignorance they did not perceive the bareness of the land.
There were still crumbs here and there and some small fragments
of cheese not to be despised, though their Papa looked down upon
it as most plebeian food for mice of quality. And he was too 
shocked and startled by the state of things to rebuke them for
eating anything they found.</p>
 
<p>"Take comfort, my love," said his wife. "We are still a long
way from starvation. There is a good deal of sawdust and bran in
the wine-cellar, there are some remains of candle-ends in the kitchen
dresser, and even the scraps of oilcloth about the passages are not to
be despised in case of necessity."</p> 
 <p>But Papa Bright-eyes nearly fainted at her words. I am afraid
he was something of a gourmand.</p>

your suggestions are terrible. Could one have believed that human<pb/>

spite would have gone so far? Could one have believed in such
ingenuity of cruelty? The nameless one has left us, it is
true, but only to a fate almost as cruel as her claws—to slow
starvation. We must emigrate, my love, we must emigrate!"</p>
 
 <p>"To a country where no nameless ones are to be found, then, I
hope,” said Mrs. Bright-eyes. "For my part I’d rather make the
best of sawdust and oilcloth, and even a nibble at wall-paper now
and then, than risk coming across any of that lot, I must say."</p>
 
<p>But as a week or two passed, and the last scraps of cheese had
disappeared, and mouldy bran grew rather monotonous fare, even
Mamma Bright-eyes began to urge upon her husband the desirability
of a voyage of discovery into one of the neighbouring houses which
were not to let. And there is no knowing what the unfortunate
family might not have been driven to, had not an unexpected
event happened.</p>
 
<p>Till now the house had been left empty. The old gentleman
and lady were in some ways a little too economically inclined, and
they had felt so sure of finding tenants or purchasers at once that
they had not thought it necessary to put in a caretaker. But it was a
bad season for letting or selling houses, and at last their agent persuaded
them to put some one in charge who could "keep the dust down" and
answer any inquiries that might be made at the door. So one morn-<pb/>

                        Bessie, who was of a sociable disposition and not troubled with
shyness, stopped short at sight of the little maiden and looked at her
inquiringly. The nurses and the two little brothers were some way
down the street, coming along more slowly. A smile came over
the rosy face, and to Bessie this smile was irresistible.</p>
 
               <p>"Are you—have you come to live here?" she added.</p>
 
               <p>"Please'm, yes'm," replied the child promptly. "Mother and
me's a-caretaking, but mother’s out charing. She said as how I 
might stand 'ere to take the air a bit—it's beautiful air it is, Miss,
in this 'ere street," she burst out enthusiastically, "but as how I
mustn't step outside the gate. It isn't every day as mother's
charing—just permiscous-like, you see."</p>

could not by any means understand all that the child said, but this
question seemed safe ground.</p>

sweep the rooms. And there's mice, Miss, as'd make you die with
laughing. They seem half starved, they're so uncommon hungry.
They'll eat the crumbs and we as close as close. I never did see
such mice."</p>

<ins>W</ins>HEN Poppy had had air enough and staring up and down the street
enough, she retired into the kitchen.
It was dinner time by now. She
got out a plate with a bit of
cold boiled bacon, and managed
cleverly enough, by the aid of
a shovel, to warm up a roast
potato over from last night's
supper. And then she sat down to
enjoy this unusually good dinner, as
happy as a queen. Had she not
every reason to be happy? No
more question of rent—a nice bit of fire, a good dinner,mother's
face cheerier than it had been since the long ago golden days,

                        remembered by little Poppy but as in a dream, when "father"
was alive and earning good wages.</p>
 
               <p>The smell of the bacon and hot potato skin reached other
nostrils besides Poppy's. Father Bright-eyes was on the watch.
Things had been coming to a very bad pass with him and his
family the last few days, and hunger makes brave. Besides,
Poppy was far less alarming than a certain not-to-be-named
personage. As she slowly finished the last scraps of her dinner,
a slight, very slight sound behind her made her look round,
and the long tail of Papa Bright-eyes caught her glance ere
he whisked it after him down the hole in the corner of the
cupboard.</p>
 
               <p>"Ah, there you are, mousey," said the little girl, "don’t be
afraid, poor dear. I'm not a-going to hurt you. And I've left
some nice crumbs of potato skin and a bit of bacon rind for you.
See there, I'll put it down in front of the 'earth, so as you can
be nice and warm while you eats it. And I'm just a-going to
take a nap, so I'll not even see as you're there. You've no call
to be afraid—go and fetch all the family if you please. We've
no cat—mother and me, we don't hold with cats."</p>

her, and the scrap of bacon rind smelt so good that hunger
overcame prudence, and in another minute he was dining most

It was long since he had had so good a meal, but he would
not keep it all for himself. Back to the cupboard he flitted,
returning in a moment with Mrs. Bright-eyes and the four
small ones. There was not very much dinner for them after
all, but what there was tasted very good, and not the tiniest
crumb was left when they had finished.</p>
 
               <p>All this time Poppy was peeping at them through her fingers,
though she took care to keep perfectly still.</p>
 
               <p>"One, two, three, four," she counted, "oh what fun! Six
little mice. My! mustn't they just be hungry to come out so
bold—poor little mice. I wish I'd more to give you. I'll try
and save a scrap or two of my supper. Wouldn't the young
lady and gentleman like to see them? That little fellow with
the funny twist in his tail is the sharpest of all—how he
does flash about! I wonder if they won't get to know me
quite well once they sees I'm not a-going to hurt 'em."</p>
 
               <p>She moved her foot a very little, just to try. In an instant,
as if by magic, the whole six had disappeared—Poppy could
almost have fancied it a dream that they had been there at all!</p>
 
               <p>She went up the area steps again when she had "washed
up," as she called it, though, as the things consisted only of one

was the hearth to sweep up however, and a lump of coal to
be carefully placed so that it would last till mother came in,
and tea had to be got ready; so Poppy felt herself quite a
housekeeper. She glanced at the opposite house, but there were
no faces at the nursery window; for just then Jack and Bessie
were more profitably occupied in discussing their dinner. So
Poppy got out her knitting when she came in again, and
settled herself in the big arm-chair, wondering how many rounds
of her stocking she would be able to get done before mother
came home. And then a queer thing happened. A very, very
soft sound made her look, not up, but down, for the sound
came from below. There, just where her feet would have
come to had her legs been longer, stood a mouse—a very small
one, with a slight twist at the end of his long tail. He lifted
his two front paws much as a squirrel does when he is holding
a nut to nibble, only poor mousey had no nut.</p>
               <p>"Poppy," he said in a clear squeaky voice, "I have crept
out all of myself to speak to you. I am sure you are good
and kind. We have been in great trouble—we have been
nearly starving, and my Papa and Mamma had almost made
up their minds to emigrate" (here the mouse's feelings choked

slipper and her stocking. How provoking! Several stitches had

WHEN Jack and
Bessie came into
the day-nursery for their
breakfast the next morn-
ing they ran to the
window to look out.
Yes, there at the top of
the area steps, looking
up and down the street,
just like the day before,
stood Poppy. It was a
bright morning, though
rather chilly — the sun
was in Poppy’s eyes,
and she did not see the
two faces pressed against
the window pane, till

                        a tinkling sort of knocking made her look up. Jack was drumming
on the glass with a tin trumpet. Then Poppy’s face broke out in
smiles. She nodded and they nodded. Next a sudden idea struck
her. She held out all the fingers of one hand and the fore-
finger of the other, bobbing them down in turns to show she
was counting.</p>

               <p>"One, two, three, four, five, six," she said aloud, as if her voice
could possibly have reached them.</p>
 
               <p>"What can she mean ?" said Bessie, "she keeps counting up to
six, do you see, Jack? I'll try to make her understand that we'll
talk to her again when we go out." And a series of very funny
signs and pointings ensued, which unfortunatelv Poppy could not
understand at all.</p> 
               <p>But she kept her eye on the opposite house all the morning,
and she was at her post when at last the door opened and the two
children ran out. The nurses were getting the little ones down
stairs and there was always some delay with the perambulator, so
Jack and Bessie had time for a word or two.</p> 
               <p>"What were you counting on your fingers this morning, Poppy?"
asked Bessie.</p>

                        "Oh, Miss, don't you laugh at me now, but p'r'aps I were
dreaming. All the same I promised," and she related Flip's visit
the evening before.</p>

               <p>Jack and Bessie were delighted. They would have stayed
talking to Poppy for some time longer, had not a bumping,
jerking sound across the street announced the exit of the per-
ambulator. So off they flew. But Poppy's communications
gave them plenty to chatter about to each other that morning.
Was it a dream, or could it be that mice could sometimes speak?</p>
 
               <p>From this time forward not many days passed on which they did
not manage to have a little conversation with Poppy. Their nurse
noticed her standing at the gate once or twice but without paying
particular attention, and as the child bobbed a courtesy and a pleasant
good morning, she was quite satisfied when Bessie spoke of her as
"the caretaker's little girl opposite." Not that Jack and Bessie had
the least idea of concealing their acquaintance with Poppy. If any
one had asked about it they would have told all there was to tell,
but no one happened to do so. Their mother was even more busy
than usual just then, as the big sisters were without a governess, and
she had herself to help them in preparing their lessons for their
various masters.</p>

                        Poppy's mother seemed to be in great request just then. "It
never rains but it pours," says the proverb, and now that she was
living rent free she had more "charing" than during all the
past hard winter. When she came home in the evening she
was often too tired to tell her little daughter the stories that
had always been the child's favourites—of "when poor father
was alive and we lived in the country." "The country" was
Poppy's fairyland; she had never seen it that she could re-
member, she tried to picture it to herself from her mother's
descriptions, to be sure, but still, as the good woman told her,
"no words could give the feel of it." And they used to build
castles in the air together of a day when they should have
saved enough to go for some hours by one of the cheap excursions
they saw posters about at the railway stations, "right into the
real country."</p>
 
               <p>But lately the story-telling had been on Poppy's side much more
than on her mother's. The poor woman was often so tired now
that she liked better to listen than to talk, and Poppy was very
pleased to retail all her conversations with Jack and Bessie, and she
was also very fond of chattering to her mother about Flip and his
brothers and sisters.</p>

with a smile. "How I do wish I could show you some of the
pretty wild creatures as lives in the woods! The squirrels with
their long tails, and the rabbits a-scuttling about, and the birds.
When I was as little as you, Poppy, I used to know 'em all by sight
and by sound you might say—you've no notion what a lot of kinds
of birds there was down our way."</p>

                        "Wouldn't I like to see them!" said Poppy. "I do like alive
things, mother. I'd rather a deal have the mice running about than
nothing stirring when you're out. And I do believe as the little one
with the twisty tail as I was telling you of, is getting to know me.
I always put some crumbs for 'em at the same place, and now they'll
come close to my foot."</p>
               <p>"I can’t say as I’m partial to mice," said Poppy's mother. "Still,
I don't suppose they can do much harm here in this empty house.
If I thought they were mischievous, Poppy, I'd have to get a
cat."</p>
 
               <p>"Oh, mother," almost screamed Poppy, "you'd never go for to
do that! They'll do no mischief—you may be sure. Flip
promised—you remember, mother, I told you. And if it was a
dream, there's dreams as is true. Oh, mother,, you'll never get
a cat."</p>
 
               <p>Poppy looked ready to cry. But her mother comforted her by
saying she had no wish to get a cat; "cats was great worries, and
took a deal of milk," there was no need for Poppy to work
herself up.</p> 
               <p>Some one else was very glad to hear what Poppy's mother said.
Father Bright-eyes was peeping out of the cupboard, listening.

                        Things had been better of late, for though the fare was certainly not
as good as in the old days, the scraps which Poppy provided were
much to be preferred to sawdust and oilcloth. And then even if
there were not much, at least it could be eaten in peace!</p><pb/>

                        CHAPTER V. THE BIRTHDAY WISH.
                  <ins>W</ins>E have a great deal to be thankful for," the old
mouse had been remarking to his better-half the
morning of the very day on which the appalling
question of "getting a cat" had been discussed, "the absence
of some one who shall be nameless makes up for much. On
the whole I don't see that we should be likely to mend matters.

                        "Certainly not, in my humble opinion," put in Flip, with a
jerk of his distinguished tail. "I am really in a position to
advise you, my dear father, from my intimacy with our bene-
factress, Poppy. So long as we conduct ourselves as well-
bred mice always prefer to do, we have no reason for
uneasiness."</p>

               <p>Father Bright-eyes looked at his eldest son admiringly.</p>
 
               <p>"How he expresses himself," he thought. "He is really a
mouse any parents might be proud of. Take him altogether—
the twist in his tail is of course a great natural advantage—but
take him altogether we have not done so badly by him, my dear,"
he observed to Mrs. Bright-eyes, when sure that Flip was out
of hearing. For he was far too sensible, of course, to praise
him to his face. "I am not at all surprised that Poppy, as
he calls her, should have taken him under her special protection."</p>
 
               <p>The spring was coming on by now. Already some baskets of
primroses had found their way down the street where Jack and
Bessie and Poppy lived, and one day when, as usual, the opposite
neighbours were having a little talk while waiting for the
perambulator, Jack stuffed a tiny bunch of violets into the small
caretaker's hands.</p>

                       "My!" she exclaimed, poking her round nose into the middle
of the posy, "but they do smell sweet. Thank you kindly,
Master Jack. Has they come from the country, should
you think now, from the real country ?" and her eyes sparkled.</p>
 
               <p>"To be sure," Jack replied. "We’ll bring you more next
week, Poppy. We're going to the country to spend the day on

                        "We’ve got the same birthday," said Bessie. "Isn’t it funny?
though Jack's seven and I'm only six. We have a treat every
birthday—a treat and a wish—the treat's to be going to the country,
but we haven't fixed the wish yet."</p>
 
               <p>But Poppy could only repeat, "Going to the country, the real
country. You'll tell me all about it, master and missy, won't
you?"</p>
 
               <p>"Of course. But we've often been there. We go every year.
Have you never been in the country, Poppy?"</p>

               <p>Poppy shook her head.</p>
 
               <p>"Never as I can remember," she said. "Mother's going to
take me some day, though, only it won't be till she's saved a good
bit. Do them flowers," and she pointed to the violets, "do they
grow always? and the primroses?—I'd dearly love to see 'em all
a-growing."</p>

               <p>"They only grow in the spring," said Bessie. "At least—at
least the primroses. I'm not quite sure about the violets," and
she looked at Jack. But Jack was too wise to commit himself.
"Poor Poppy, I wish you could come to the country in the
spring."</p>

so closely how others—children of their own age—have to "do
without." And the day that this does come home to us is a marked
one in our lives. Marked in a very blessed way if it leads to doing,
as well as feeling.</p>
               <p>"Jack," said Bessie after a while. "I think my birthday wish is
beginning to get fixed. Is yours?"</p>

               <p>"I—I almost think so too," said Jack</p>

               <p>"I had thought of a doll's dinner-service," said Bessie with a
slight quiver in her voice.</p>
 
               <p>"And I was thinking of a winding-up steam-engine," said Jack
rather gruffly.</p>
 
               <p>And then for a day or two they said no more about it.</p>
 
               <p>Mammas of all ranks, I think, must be pretty well used to being
surprised. Children would not be children, and certainly much
less nice than they are, if one always knew or at least had a very
good idea of what they were going to do or say. But Jack's and
Bessie's Mamma was rather extra surprised when, a few days before
the double birthday, the two children came to tell her they had
fixed what their wish was to be, and that it was "to take Poppy
with us to the country."</p>

                        "To take whom?" asked Mamma, hastily running over in her
mind all the individuals, dog, cat, toy-horse, or doll, that "Poppy"
could possibly be.</p>

               <p>"She's the little caretaker at No. 9, and she's never seen
the country, not to say to remember it. And her mother goes
out charing, and her real name's Sleena Mary," Bessie ran off

Bessie, what

getting up as she spoke. But
Jack and Bessie pulled her
back.</p>

               <p>"Oh, Mamma dear, it's no
harm. Don't be vexed with
nurse. We've only talked to
her a little, and she told us
about the mice, and she's very
good. You would see she's
good," they intreated. So
Mamma sat down again and
listened to the whole, and her
face grew kinder and kinder,
as Bessie nudged Jack to ob-
serve, especially when they came to the part of Poppy's longing
to see primroses really a-growing. And the kind look grew more
than kind when the two Jacks-in-the-middle explained that the

                        "wish" was not to cost them nothing, but was to be at the price

<ins>The</ins> very next day Poppy's mother,
who happened to be at home,
had a visitor—a visitor so gentle
and friendly and sympathizing that
her whole simple story, from the old
days of "when father was alive and
we lived in the country" to the present
good-luck of "a winter rent-free," was soon
told. And Poppy's--that is to say "Sleena
Mary's" — small womanly ways and funny fancies, brought
smiles to the visitor's face.</p>
 
               <p>"Never was such a child for amusin' of herself," said the mother.
"She'll be goin' to school again, but I had to keep her at home a
bit this winter, for her eyes was weakly and the doctor wouldn't let

set her up."</p>
 
               <p>"It seems a nice house," said the children's mother, "and you
keep it so tidy."</p>
 
               <p>"It's nice and clean all over. The old people as lived here was
very pertickler, and Poppy's always a-keeping down the dust," said
the caretaker with pride. And she was very proud to show the lady
through the rooms.</p>
 
               <p>"It is a very nice house," she repeated as she went. And to
herself she added— "I think it would be the very thing for them if
they decide upon taking a house, and it would be nice to have them
so near." The long-looked-for birthday fell on a Wednesday.
People are fond of saying that things very seldom turn out as we
wish them in this world, and perhaps in some ways this is true.
Still I have noticed that sometimes, and especially when really good
and kind and nice wishes are concerned, things do often turn out very
right indeed. That was the case this time. Though only April, the
most fickle of months, the day was lovely, quite lovely; the sort of day
on which you could feel that the birds and the flowers and the squirrels
and the rabbits, with thoughts of which little Poppy's head was
stuffed full, must be all enjoying themselves thoroughly. And never G

Papa had said they must have for the

usual place for them.</p>
 
               <p>An hour and a half brought the travellers to their journey's end.
By this time Poppy was almost speechless with delight. The first
real green fields and woods had been met by her with cries of pleasure,
but when, as they went further, the country grew still prettier, and
here and there on the banks the yellow primroses smiled up in
welcome and the birds flitted about in the sunshine, she grew silent.</p>

words to say—that's what it is," she answered.</p>

the train and were walking through the lanes with the cousin who
had come to meet them with her nurse.</p>

"Won't Poppy like it better than the road?"</p>
 
               <p>For the Jacks-in-the-middles' Mamma had written all about
Poppy, and Delia meant to join her cousins in making the little
caretaker's first day in the country as happy as possible.</p>

fun climbing stiles after you've been a good long while in London."</p>

                        "And this afternoon we are to go to the wood to get primroses
for auntie," said Delia. "She wrote that she wanted a lot for
a dinner-party. Mamma will lend us her nice flat flower-baskets
—we line them with damp moss and it keeps the flowers so much
fresher than when they're all on the top of each other in deep
baskets. If only it was warmer we might have had tea in the
wood."</p>
 
               <p>"Tea in the wood," repeated Poppy, in amazement.</p>
 
               <p>Then they had to explain to her all about gipsy teas and picnics,
and nutting and blackberrying expeditions, till the poor little girl
became quite convinced that, as she told her mother that evening,
Heaven itself couldn't be much beautifuller to live in than the
country.</p>
 
               <p>The whole day was to her a dream of delight, and I am quite
sure that the sight of her pleasure had a good deal to do with
Jack's and Bessie's conviction that this was the happiest birthday
they had ever had.</p>

               <p>They were all at the primrose gathering when they arrived
at this conclusion. They had had a very good dinner indeed
in Delia's nursery, and Poppy had had dinner with them.</p>
 
               <p>"For you see, auntie," said Bessie, when Delia's mother had

                        consulted her and nurse on this knotty point, "it wouldn't seem so
like treating her as a friend if we sent her down to have her dinner
in the kitchen, would it? And very likely she'd be too shy to eat.
She's not a bit shy with us, is she, Carter?"</p>

"No, Miss Bessie, she seems to me just right, for she's not forward
neither. She's really a very well-behaved little girl, ma'am," she
added, to Delia's mother.</p>

               <p>"So I think," she replied.</p>
 
               <p>They lent Poppy a basket, so that she might fill it herself with
primroses for her mother.</p>
 
               <p>"Wont' she just be pleased?" she said. "She does so love the
country. Does these beautiful flowers grow always here, Miss?"</p>

                        "Oh no, only in the spring," Bessie replied. "But in summer
there's lots of other kinds—honeysuckle and dog-roses and wild
hyacinths and—and—oh lots, But I don't think any are as pretty
as the spring ones; do you, Delia?"</p>
 
               <p>"I don't know," Delia replied. "Perhaps it seems so because
we're so pleased to see them after the winter. "Hush," she cried
suddenly, "be quite quiet—there's a field-mouse—don't you see?
there under the leaves. Oh, it's gone! I do so like them; they
have such bright eyes."</p>
 
               <p>Poppy gazed before her in astonishment.</p>
 
               <p>"A field-mouse," she said. "Is there mice as lives in the country,
just like there's people as lives there?" </p>

               <p>All the other children laughed.</p>
 
               <p>"Yes, of course," they said.</p>

               <p>"I wish I'd seen him," she said. "That'll be something to tell
Flip about, next time he comes for his dinner," she added to herself.
"Poor. Flip! I wish I could have brought him to see the
country too."</p>

                        CHAPTER VII. A Mouse Conclave. 
The happy day came to an end at
last, as all days both happy and
sad do. But in one way it did
not come to an end:
indeed its pleasure lasted
on for a good many
other days to come, for Poppy
especially — the telling mother all
about it was so delightful.</p>

               <p>And another pair of ears besides
mother's took it in too. Flip was there,
in a corner of the kitchen where no
one saw him, listening eagerly. He
had missed Poppy the day before, and a
great deal of curiosity had been felt by all the Bright-eyes family
as to what had become of her, and Flip had run out into the

                         kitchen extra early that morning to find out if she had come back
again.</p>
 
               <p>No, Poppy was not there, only her mother who seemed very
busy cooking something—was she cooking? thought Flip—on the
dresser. It must be something very nice, surely; she had such a
pleased smile on her thin face. He waited till she went into the
next room, a nice airy room behind the kitchen where she and
her little daughter slept, and then like a flash of lightning he was
up on the top of the dresser, peering about with his gleaming black
eyes, snuffing about with his sharp little nose, in search of the
wonderful dish which had so absorbed the caretaker's attention.
There was nothing to smell, almost nothing at least, only a faint,
fresh perfume which Flip had never come in contact with before,
and to see, why what was that? A round flat dish, an old
soup-plate in fact, filled almost to the outside edge with pale
yellow blossoms, bordered by soft green leaves, which Poppy's
mother had carefully set round them as a frame. Flip did not
call them blossoms and leaves; poor Flip, in spite of his ances-
tral tail and his cleverness, he was only a town mouse, he had
never seen the fields and the hedges and had no wish to
do so!</p>

                        "Funny, looking things," he said to himself, "they have
almost no scent, and I don't think they can be good to eat."</p>
 
               <p>He was stepping cautiously along the edge, for he was sharp
enough to descry water not far off.</p>

               <p>"Let's see," and he nibbled one delicate petal. "Faugh! Horrid,
tasteless stuff, what in the world was the silly old woman looking so
delighted at?"</p>

               <p>Just then Poppy and her mother came into the kitchen; Flip
hastily decamped to a shady corner, but not before the caretaker
had caught sight of his tail.</p>
 
               <p>"I declare," she said, "if that isn't owdacious! one of those mice
of yours, Poppy, a'sniffin at the primroses."</p>

                        "Oh don't touch him, mother," cried the little girl anxiously,
not that there was any fear truly of the caretaker's being able to
do so! "It's Flip, I'm sure; I dare say he knows I've been in
the country. I'm not sure if I told him, but he may have heard
us talking about it."</p>

               <p>Flip smiled to himself in his corner, and decided to stay and hear
more. But Poppy's mother looked at her rather anxiously: the
little girl was rubbing her eyes and her rosy face looked drowsy
though smiling.</p>

               <p>"My deary, you've not had your sleep out, you’re dreaming still,"
she said.</p>

               <p>Poppy shook her head.</p>

               <p>"No, I'm not indeed," she said. But seeing that her mother
seemed uneasy, she said no more about Flip and his family. "Shall
I go on telling you about it all yesterday, mother dear?" she said. 
"You like that better than my mouse stories, don't you? But
there's mice in the country too, did you know that? just as there
is children in the town and children in the country, you know,
mother. It do seem quite natural-like, don't it ?"</p>
 
               <p>"Field-mice is not quite the same kind, I don't think," said her
mother. "And children is children all the world over, I take it."</p>

                        "No, no, mother, you're wrong there," said Poppy brightly,
"and I can prove it you. Many a time you've said to me I was
more like a country-child than a town-child, 'cos of my rosy cheeks.
There now, mother."</p>
 
               <p>They had a laugh over this, and then Poppy went on with her
glowing account of all she had seen and done the day before,
finishing up with the old wish.</p>

               <p>"Oh, mother, if we could but go and live in the country like we
used to when I was a baby!"</p>

               <p>And Flip listened too, with all his ears.</p>
 
               <p>There was a great discussion that evening in the nest of the
Bright-eyes family. It is at night, as perhaps you know, that mice
are at their best and sharpest, so all questions of importance among
them are talked over when we, tail-less, two-legged beings are
asleep and dreaming, and Flip waited till night to tell his father
and mother and brothers and sisters of all the wonderful things
he had been hearing, and to propose that they should all as a family
emigrate to the country.</p>

               <p>But Papa shook his head. He thought his son very sharp and
clever, but still—"there is a very great deal to consider and inquire
about," he said, "a very great deal. First and foremost what about,"

strange land you speak of?"</p>

necessaries as bread-crumbs and cheese?"</p>

               <p>Flip hesitated, he had not gone into all these matters of detail
as yet; no doubt the cousins of whom Poppy had spoken, would
furnish them with all information. But here his Mamma interrupted.
She did not feel too sure on that point; there were cousins
and cousins, and these country cousins were but distant con-
nections. She remembered, but vaguely only, having heard of
them in her young mousehood, but certainly not as near
relatives. Flip began to feel rather small; suddenly a bright idea
struck him.</p>

                        "Permit me, my dear parents," he said. "I do not see that
any of the objections you have urged are very important, though
of course they should be considered. But a new reflection strikes
me, which I fear good feeling will force us to give in to. However
greatly to our advantage it might be to emigrate, what of our bene-
factors and friends, Poppy and her mother! Would it not be
too ungrateful, too heartless of us to leave them? Think of
Poppy's distress!" here his voice broke and his emotion spread to
the others. The whole family wept silently. "No, no," Flip
continued, "we cannot think of it. I withdraw my proposal. For
Poppy's sake, for dear Poppy's sake the Bright-eyes family will not
desert No. 9."</p>

                        CHAPTER VIII. POPPY GIVES AND TAKES ADVICE. 
<ins>P</ins>OPPY was sitting alone in the kitchen
next afternoon—that is to say the
afternoon but one after the birthday treat
-at her knitting as usual. Her mother
was out, but she had promised to
be home by tea-time.</p>

               <p>"I wish she would come," thought
the little girl. "I've several more
things to tell her that I'd for-
gotten. How nice it would be to
be living somewhere where mother
didn't need to go out all day and
leave me alone; I'll be glad to go
back to school again," and she gave a little sigh. "I wonder
what Master Jack and Miss Bessie are doin' to-day. They said
they'd come over to see me soon, but of course they've got their

                        lessons to do and a many other things, and it'd never do, as
mother says, for me to put myself for'ard too much, though
they've been so wonderful good to me."</p>
 
               <p>She was feeling a little dull after the great excitement of the
birthday treat, and perhaps she was still rather tired with the rail-
way and the exercise in the fresh air, all so unusual in her quiet
life. The knitting-needles dropped from her hands, her little
round head fell back against the rail of the high, old-fashioned
rocking-chair, and Poppy was fast asleep.</p>

               <p>Suddenly—she sat straight up with a start—something had touched
her foot, nay, something was moving right up her leg and—lo!
and behold—a pair of bright eyes were staring up in her face.
Flip, tail and all, was sitting on her knee! For half an instant
Poppy felt inclined to scream. Even if one is on very friendly terms
with mice one doesn't quite like to feel them running over one.
But before she had time to get her breath for even the tiniest cry,
a little voice stopped her.</p>
 
               <p>"Forgive me, dear Poppy, I beg of you," it said. "I would
not have taken such a liberty as to run up your leg, had not
all other means of attracting your attention failed."</p>

               <p>"Dear me," thought Poppy, "how very grandly he talks!
I wonder if he goes to school now and learns all those long words

                        there?" But as she was afraid of hurting Flip's feelings she did
not say this aloud.</p>
 
               <p>"Never mind," she replied. "I didn't like it much when I
felt you on my legs, but if you'll sit still now and not flop about
your long tail I dare say I'll get used to you. Why haven't
you been to see me for so long—though
to be sure," she added, with considerable
pride, "I've been away—you didn't know,
did you, that I'd been in the country—ever
so far?"</p>
 
               <p>Flip gave a superior smile,
but I am afraid it was lost
on Poppy. It takes a
good deal of education to
see when a mouse is smiling.</p>

               <p>"Oh dear, yes," he said,
"I know all about it. I
ventured to listen to all
you were telling your
good mother yesterday, and
it gave me great food for
thought. In fact—I particularly wanted to

tell you about it, that was why I intruded this afternoon—we had
a very serious discussion last night as to whether we, the Bright-
eyes family, might not do well to emigrate ourselves to the country.
Hearing of our cousins still being there made us feel we should
not be without friends; and there seem to be other advantages.
You—you do not appear to have come across any member of the
—the family who shall be nameless?" he added, dropping his voice
and speaking rather nervously.</p>

               <p>Poppy did not immediately reply.</p>

               <p>"I'd really like to put him down a little," she said to herself,
"he is so affected. Well," she added aloud, "and when are you
thinking of starting—all six of you, I suppose? And how do you
mean to get there? And how would you like sleeping out in the
fields and hedges, where it's pretty cold very often I dare say,
you that's used to a nice warm kitchen! And how would you do
without the scraps and crumbs we give you; I suppose you think
you'd get better fare from your grand-cousins—eh?"</p>

               <p>Flip looked very reproachful.</p>
 
               <p>"Poppy," he said, "you might listen to all I have to tell you.
We decided against it. I proposed and it was unanimously agreed
that—" and here Flip's feelings became too much for him, he lifted
up one paw and wiped his right eye, "that it would be—would be

who have been kind friends to us, to leave you. No, Poppy, we
do not deserve your sharp words—we decided that we would not

               <p>Poppy's tender heart was touched at once.</p>
 
               <p>"Poor Flip," she exclaimed, "I'm very sorry if I've hurt your
feelings. But I'm very glad you've given up the idea, for though
I wouldn't have mentioned it if you hadn't asked
me—for I know you don't like talking about it

cousin to Master Jack and Miss Bessie

all over, "do not, I entreat of you do not say the word.
How thankful, oh how thankful I am that we gave up the
idea!"</p>

               <p>"Yes, indeed, and so you may be," said Poppy. "For I
rather fancy there’s more c------ more of them about. There's
stables you know, and all sorts of farm places, and there's sure
to be—"</p>

               <p>"Say no more," sighed Flip. "Ah, how I pity our poor
cousins!"</p>

               <p>Poppy looked puzzled.</p>
 
               <p>"I don't think field-mice are the same," she said. "They live
out-of-doors altogether you see—but you couldn't do that, Flip, you'd
die of cold. Best let well alone."</p>

               <p>Just then the door was heard to open; the caretaker was coming
in. Off darted Flip, and Poppy sat up and rubbed her eyes.
"My deary, have you been taking a nap?" said her mother.</p>
 
               <p>"I don't know," Poppy replied. And after a minute she spoke
again, "Mother," she said, "is it wrong of me to want so to go
to live in the country? Is it best to be pleased always to stay where
one is?"</p>

               <p>"It's best to do one's duty, and things gets clear as one goes
on," said her mother. "Don't think too much about it, deary.

                        CHAPTER IX. BAD NEWS. 
<ins>A</ins> DAY or two after Poppy's conversation
with Flip, there came a particularly bright
and sunny morning. Such mornings, in
London especially, are rare in early spring-
time.</p>
 
               <p>"It does one good to see the sun
shining so," said the caretaker, as she
set off on a day's charing. "You
might bring your work and sit on
the top of the area steps a bit,
Poppy, if you put your little shawl
on, after you've tidied up."</p>

               <p>"Yes, mother, and may be I'll
see Master Jack and Miss Bessie if they
pass. Such a fine morning they're pretty sure to be goin' out a
walk early," the little girl replied.</p>

               <p>She was not mistaken. Just about eleven o'clock when she

                        and her knitting needles were comfortably settled on the top
step, the door of the house opposite opened and the usual little
party sallied forth. Jack and Bessie were across the street in
an instant.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Poppy," they both exclaimed. "We've been
so wanting to see you. Were you very tired the day after our
birthday?"</p>
 
               <p>"I was a bit sleepy," Poppy answered, her round face broadening
out into a smile, "but what did that matter? Oh, Miss Bessie,
but it was a beautiful day! I'll never forget it—no, never. I've
been wantin' dreadful to see you to tell you again how I did enjoy it!"</p>

               <p>"I am so glad you did," exclaimed Bessie, and Jack joined in
of course.</p>
 
               <p>"You'll have some more treats like it some day p'r'aps," said he in
his slow way. He was not near so quick as Bessie, though he was
a year older. "When we go to the country—we always do, you
know, about July or August, isn't it, Bessie?—we're going to ask
Mamma for you to come there, aren't we, Bessie?"</p>

               <p>"Oh, I do hope it'll be in my holidays," said Poppy, clasping
her hands together."(sic) Do you think it will, miss? For I'm goin'
to school again now reg'lar. I'm to begin on Monday."</p>

the baby but one, by the hand this morning, for it was so
fine and dry nurse thought it would do him good to walk,
and the baby was having an extra long sleep, and was not
therefore ready to come out so early.</p>
 
               <p>"Is your mother in, Poppy?" Carter asked, and on the child
shaking her head, "Will she be in to-morrow?" the
nurse went on, "No, I don't mean to-
morrow, for that's Sunday, Monday,
I should say?"</p>

               <p>"Yes," Poppy went on, "sure
to be. She ain't a goin'
out so much now, for

to leave the house too

explain. It'll be all right."—"The child wouldn't understand,
the ladies will tell her mother themselves," thought the nurse
to herself, in which she made a mistake, not knowing how very
"understanding" Poppy was. And this mistake of hers caused
a good deal of sorrow that might have been avoided.</p>
 
               <p>Then the children bade their little friend good-bye and went
on for their walk, leaving her with new fancies out of which
to spin pleasant day-dreams.</p>
 
               <p>"To go down to see them in the country again," thought Poppy.
"Oh, I do hope it'll be in my holidays. I'll work my best at school,
that I will, so as I'll deserve a treat if it comes, as mother
says."</p>

               <p>And full of these good resolutions, the little maiden set off for
school on Monday morning. She was a favourite there, for she
was both quick and willing, and she was pleased to find herself
put back in her former place, even though she had been three
months absent.</p>

               <p>"You were well on for your age before you were away,
Selina," the teacher said. "I should be sorry to put you back. If
you can work a little extra at home for a week or two, I think
you may keep up. Your eyes are quite well again?"</p>

               <p>Swinging her bag of
books little Poppy
ran cheerily home.
It was nice to know
mother would be there. What had
the nurse asked if she'd be in for?
she wondered. She had forgotten about it till now, and she had
not told her mother. But the nurse had said it didn't matter—
perhaps it was just that Bessie's Mamma was coming over to speak
to the charwoman, as she had done before.</p>
 
               <p>Yes, mother was there; the door was opened as soon as Poppy
knocked. And mother smiled and listened to all the child had

                        to tell, so that for a moment or two, Poppy did not notice that she
was pale and her eyes rather red, as if she had been crying a
little. But as soon as she did see it she flew to her mother and
kissed her.</p>

               <p>"Is there anything the matter? Are you ill, dear mother?"
she asked anxiously.</p>

               <p>"No, no, deary," said the poor woman, trying to smile and
checking back the tears, "it's downright ongrateful of me, it is,
to make a trouble of what was bound to come. I should be
thankful for the good its done us, you 'specially, Poppy. You're
not to say the same child as when we came here, and—"</p>
 
               <p>Poppy's rosy face grew pale too.</p>

               <p>"I know," she said, "the house is took."</p>
 
               <p>Her mother answered more brightly,</p>
 
               <p>"Not to say took, but it looks like it," she said. "But, Poppy
love, we mustn't make a trouble of it, we mustn't indeed. There's
been some ladies to look at it, and by all I could hear they liked
it very much and said it seemed just the thing. They were
very civil to me and give me a shilling for my trouble—real ladies
they was. But of course I couldn't have axed no questions as to
when it'd be for, and such-like. We'll just have to cheer-up and
make the best of it. I'll step round to the agent's in a few days,

               <p>"Will you go back to Smith Street, do you think, mother?"
asked Poppy in a voice which she vainly tried to keep from
trembling.</p>

               <p>The caretaker shook her head.</p>

               <p>"But not far from here, mother," said Poppy. "I'd never see
Master Jack and Miss Bessie if it was far."</p>
 
               <p>Her mother promised to do her best. But they were both very
sad, poor things. Curiously enough Poppy never thought again of
the nurse's undelivered message—it never struck her that it could
have anything to do with the visit of the stranger ladies to see the
house.</p>

<ins>A</ins> FEW days went on and no-
thing was heard by Poppy
and her mother about the
house being taken. They
were almost beginning to
hope that it had been a
false alarm, for "there's
many a slip 'twixt the cup
and the lip," said the caretaker,
who was rather fond of proverbs,
when one morning, just as Poppy
was coming in from school, there appeared a man sent by the
agent to take down the board announcing that the "desirable
residence was to be sold or let."</p>
 
               <p>"And you'll clean off the paper in the front window too, please,"
said the young man, civilly enough, as he was leaving.</p>

                        "Then it's quite true — the house is really taken?" she
said.</p>

               <p>"Certainly it is," he replied, "and a good job too for the owners."</p>
 
               <p>"To be sure," she said, trying to smile, "what's one man's
meat is another man's poison," which the agent thought rather a
good joke.</p>
 
               <p>"You don't know as your gentleman is in want of a caretaker
for any other house, do you?" she said timidly.</p>

               <p>"Can't say, I'm sure. But there's houses dropping in every
day. T'would do no harm for you to step round and ask for
yourself. And oh, by the by, I was forgetting I was to tell you
you needn't turn out till you hear more. The party that's taken the
house might want you to stay on a bit when their things begin
to come in—"</p>
               <p>"When are they coming?"</p>
 
               <p>"They want to be in and settled by the middle of May," he
said. "You'll come in for the cleaning-down, maybe. You see
there's not much painting or papering needed; it's in such
good condition."</p>
 
               <p>And with these words he took his departure.</p>
 
               <p>Considering what he had told her, Poppy's mother thought it
best not to "step round" to the agent's.</p>

                        turned up. She had been out on this errand the following Wednesday
afternoon, Poppy's half-holiday, leaving the little girl in charge—
Poppy only thought that her mother had been out shopping
—so as the caretaker came near to number nine on her return,
she was surprised to see the child looking out for her with evident
eagerness.</p>

               <p>"Nothing wrong, deary?" she said cheerfully, though with a
little sinking at her heart. Her small "house hunting" on her
own account had not tended to raise her spirits; she minded nothing
for herself, but for Poppy! The few rooms within her means
seemed sadly poor and stuffy; surely the rents had gone up even
in the last few months? "nothing wrong?" she repeated.
Supposing the new owners of the house were coming in at
once, and did not want her at all?</p>

               <p>"No, no, mother, at least I don't think so. The ladies, at least
one of them, has been here; it was quite a young lady; she came
to take a measure for her Mamma she said, and oh! just fancy,
mother, she was Miss Delia's—Miss Delia-in-the-country's big
sister! She's stayin' over the way, and she knowed me—she
said, 'Well, my little girl, and how have you been getting
on?'"</p>

in the country with an easy mind, my deary."</p>
 
               <p>Over the way in Jack's and Bessie's home the same subject, little
as Poppy and her mother suspected it, was being talked about.</p>
 
               <p>"I saw the little girl—I forget her name—the caretaker's little
girl at number nine, Auntie, when I went over there to measure
the drawing-room mantelpiece for mother," said Constance, Delia's
"big sister," as Poppy had described her.</p>

               <p>Her aunt started.</p>

               <p>"Oh, by the by, I meant to have gone over to speak to the
poor woman. I did send a message by Carter to tell her not to
be uneasy. But it was difficult for me to know what to say till
your mother had seen her for herself."</p>

               <p>"But Mamma did see her for herself, the other day you know,
when she came to look over the house," said Constance. "Didn't
she tell her then what we've been thinking of?"</p>

               <p>"No, several things had to be considered first and some inquiries
made. It was only yesterday I heard that your father and mother
had decided to offer her the lodge. I quite meant to have gone
over to speak to her, but I have been so exceedingly busy.
However she is a sensible woman, and she must have had my
message. I'll go over this afternoon."</p>

                        "Yes, do," said Constance. "Somehow I don't feel sure—the
poor little girl did look rather melancholy now I come to think of it."</p>
 
               <p>But the afternoon was already well advanced, and before the
children's mother could start some callers came, who stayed so
long that by the time they left it was decidedly too late. Her
visit had to be put off till the next morning.</p>
 
               <p>And all this time Poppy's heart was very sore. She did not
like to say much to her mother who was sad enough already.
She was not sorry that evening to catch sight of a small dark object
in one corner of the kitchen, which crept towards her when she
called it gently.</p>

               <p>"Flip, Flip," she said, "come and speak to me. Mother's in
the back kitchen washing. "Oh, Flip, have you heard that we're
going away—that the house is taken?"</p>

not persuade my parents to change their minds again about going

                        Flip shivered.</p>
 
               <p>"Hush!" he said. "Yes, that is true certainly. But it is a
sad look-out. Who knows what sort of people the newcomers may
be, or who," and here his voice dropped, "who may come with them?"</p>

               <p>"Poor Flip!" said Poppy, "yes, it's very sad for all of you
too. But I'll tell you what—I know the ladies who are coming
—I'll see if I can't get them to promise not to have a—you know
what. You be sure to come and have another talk with me
before we go, and I'll tell you if I've been able to ask them."</p>

               <p>"Oh, thank you, dear Poppy, thank you," said Flip. "I'll—"
but at that moment the charwoman came in, and off he scudde
tail and all!</p>

                        CHAPTER XI. ALMOST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. 
"GOOD morning, Mrs.
Orchard." (I don't
think I have ever mentioned
that Poppy's last name was
Orchard, have I? A nice
country-sounding name it
is, isn't it?) "I am so
sorry not to have come over
to see you before, but you
got my nurse's message?"
said Bessie's mother to
Poppy's, the next day when she found herself at last standing at
the door of number nine opposite.</p>
 
               <p>The caretaker stared.</p>

               <p>"No, ma'am, I don't think I've had any message," she said.
"And if it was given to Poppy, she's a thinkin' kind of child; she
wouldn't go to forget to tell me. She's just in from school, ma'am,
I'll call her. But would you kindly step down to the kitchen,

                        there's not a chair nor a stool anywhere else, though it won't be long
like that. You've heard, ma'am, as the house is taken?"</p>
 
               <p>She was rather excited at the lady's visit and it made her talk
more than usual, as she led the way to the kitchen, Bessie's mother
following her.</p>

               <p>"Yes," she replied, "it is about that I wanted to speak to you,
and it will take some little time to explain, so we may as well sit
down and talk comfortably. Oh, here is Poppy. How are you, my
dear? Didn't my second nurse give you a message from me for
your mother the other day, Poppy?"</p>

               <p>Poppy considered.</p>
 
               <p>"No, ma'am," she replied, "she only asked me if mother would
be in on Monday, and I said I knew she would be. Perhaps I
should have told mother, but I never thought of it again."</p>

               <p>"You should 'a told me," said the caretaker.</p>

               <p>"Oh, but that wasn't the message," said the lady. "There must
have been some mistake about it. My message was to tell you,
Mrs. Orchard, that the ladies who were coming to see the house
were relations of ours, and that you mustn't be put out about having
to leave, as we should think of you in making our plans. I
must speak to Carter about it."</p>
 
               <p>The poor woman's face cleared.</p>

                        "And I'm sure, ma'am, it was very kind of you to think of us.
If maybe I might make so bold, I'd be proud to do the cleaning and
see to the furniture a bit when it comes in. It'd give me nice time
to look about for a new place for us."</p>

               <p>"Certainly," her visitor replied. "I've no doubt my sister would
be glad to keep you on here a little. But I have much more to speak
of than that. How would you and Poppy like to go to the country
to live, Mrs.
Orchard? The
smaller of the
two lodges
at my
sister's, the
place Poppy
was at on their
birthday with the children, is empty, and they want some one for it.
There is not so much gate opening as at the principal lodge, and it
is close to the farm and not lonely: it is a pretty little house, and you
would have it rent-free and a few shillings a week, and you might
take in some washing."</p>

               <p>She was half surprised when she stopped speaking that there was
no reply. But glancing up, she quickly saw the reason: the tears

                        were streaming down the poor woman's face; she could not speak
while little Poppy's cheeks were crimson with excitement and
her eyes dancing in her head.</p>

               <p>"Oh! mother, mother," she cried, "don't take on so. Do tell

know where to find words for to thank you, for it's all come of your
goodness to us. I do trust as I'll show I'm grateful by doing all in
my power to serve your friends faithful."</p>

there were tears in her own eyes, I fancy,—"and I am so glad you like

                        the idea. My sister will be here herself next week, and she will come
in and see you and talk it all over. Her eldest daughter is here now."</p>
 
               <p>"Yes'm," said Poppy. "I saw it was Miss Delia's big sister,
and mother and me we hoped as maybe 'twas your ladies that were
takin' the house, because
of the cleanin' you see;
but we never thought
of anything like this!"
and the child
quite gasped
with her de-
light.</p>
 
               <p>"There's
only one
thing, ma'am,
no--there's
two things,"
she went on
confidingly.
Poppy was not
a shy child. "I'll be so sorry not to see Master Jack and Miss Bessie,"
and her pretty blue eyes grew tearful.</p>

                        "But you will see them, my dear," said the lady. "They very
often go out to their aunt's, and sometimes they stay there several
weeks. It is only for a short time of the year that my relations are
to be in London, you know."</p>

               <p>Poppy grew quite bright again.</p>
               <p>"That will be nice," she said, "and to be sure it isn't as if mother
and me had been going to stay here in this house, we might have
been several streets off."</p>
 
               <p>"And what is the other thing?" asked the children's mother.
"You said there were two?"</p>

               <p>Poppy grew very red.</p>

               <p>"It's—it's only—p'r'aps I might ask the ladies when they come
themselves," she said at last. "It's only—I do ope they won't keep a cat."</p>

               <p>She fancied she heard a slight rustle in a corner of the kitchen,
for Poppy was very quick of hearing. She was right; six pairs of
long little ears were eagerly listening for the lady's reply.</p>
 
               <p>"A cat," she repeated, looking puzzled—oh, dear, what a shud-
der went through the group of Bright-eyes standing at the door of
their hole!</p>
 
               <p>"Why shouldn't they keep a cat, my dear?"</p>
 
               <p>"Oh, ma'am, Poppy's quite silly-like about the mice," said her
mother apologetically. "There's some here that's so tame, she's
come quite to make pets of 'em. They do no harm, I'll say that
for them, and there don't seem many."</p>

                        "Only Flip—and the father and mother," said Poppy glibly.</p>

               <p>The lady could not help smiling.</p>

               <p>"Are these your names for them?" she said. "Well, now I come to
think of it, I dare say my friends will not keep a cat, for the girls have
some very favourite birds. But you'd better ask them yourself, Poppy,
when you see them next week, and perhaps you might say a word or
two for your pet mice. If they promise to be very good and not mis-
chievous, and if no other mice come to live at number nine, perhaps my
sister will allow this family to stay here unmolested. There are mice
and mice, you know; some are exceedingly tiresome and mischievous."</p>

               <p>"Ours aren't like that, I'm sure," answered Poppy. "All the
same I'll tell Flip," and seeing the amused glances between the lady
and her mother she blushed a little. "I'll tell Flip what you say,
ma'am. And when Miss Delia's Mamma comes I'll ask her. I am
so glad they don't like cats."</p>

               <p>Soon after this, Jack's and Bessie's mother went away, Mrs. Orchard
and Poppy following her with their smiling faces to the door.</p>

               <p>"It is a real pleasure to see them looking so happy," thought
the kind lady to herself.</p>
 
               <p>And oh, what a joyful afternoon the two had; talking over the
news that seemed almost too good to be true, picturing the little
cottage to themselves, planning what new things they would be able
to buy to make it look pretty and neat. "For we must be a credit
to the ladies, you see, Poppy," said her mother.</p>

<ins>B</ins>RIGHT, warm, lovely summer! If spring,
early spring even, in the country, had
seemed fairyland to little Poppy, what
words could she find for these blue and
golden days, with their wealth of flowers
and butterflies, birds singing overhead,
sleepy-eyed cows in the fields, every-
thing, so at least it seemed to her, fresh
and sweet and happy! For it was a
very lovely summer that year; such a
summer as we cannot expect, in England
at least, always.</p>
 
               <p>"And it's the twentieth of July at last, mother," said the little
girl, as she stood at the cottage door early that morning, "and
they're really coming this afternoon, Master Jack and Miss Bessie,
as well as our own ladies. Isn't it funny that Miss Delia and
Miss Constance and their Mamma should be our ladies, more

                        than Miss Bessie and her Mamma? I'll never feel as if they
were more ours, mother, I'll never love no ladies—I mean any ladies
—mother, teacher's very particular about my talkin', do you know?"</p>
 
               <p>"And a very good thing. If you're ever to be a nurse to ladies'
children as you want to be, Poppy, ladies think a deal about nice
talking. I'm too old now to change myself, but I shall be pleased
for you to learn to say the words right."</p>
 
               <p>"Yes—I told teacher so," said Poppy, but she spoke rather
absently. "Mother," she went on, "there's just one thing I'd like, to
make me perfectly happy, if only the ladies were going to drive
in at our gate, and me to open it!"</p>
 
               <p>"Nobody can have everything," said her mother smiling. "But
I tell you what—I do think we might both be standing near the
big gates, to see them when they arrive. I know it'd be all right
for me to lock up here just for once in a way."</p>
 
               <p>Poppy flew to her mother and kissed her.</p>
 
               <p>"Oh, yes, do let us," she said. "And p'raps Mr. Jemmit at
the big lodge 'll let me help to open. He's rather stiff, you know,
and the gates are very heavy. And oh, mother, you'll be sure to
have the cakes and all for beautiful to-morrow, won't you? 'Thurs-
day at five o'clock,' Miss Bessie wrote, 'we're all three coming

all round the kitchen and down the little garden path and back
again, on one foot, to calm down her spirits a little.</p>

with her mother, "I wonder if
Miss Delia will bring all her birds
down to the country. And if she
does I do hope the servants at
number nine won't go and get
a cat, mother?"</p>

               <p>Poppy looked quite distressed.</p>

               <p>"There's no fear of their getting
a cat so long as the mice do
no mischief," said her mother.
"There was no talk of it that
time I went up for two nights to
help when the cook was ill.
Indeed the servants were saying
it was a wonderful clear house for mice."</p>
 
               <p>"I'm so glad. I do so hope Flip and all of them are very
good," said Poppy, as if speaking to herself. "I'll ask Miss Delia
all the same," she added.</p>
 
               <p>And so she did, the next afternoon, when, as had been settled, the
two girls and Jack came to take tea with Mrs. Orchard and Poppy.</p>

               <p>What a happy tea-party it was! How the little guests praised the

                       cakes and the jam—and the cream—which Poppy's mother had
bought at the farm for a great treat—how pretty the neat table
looked, with a clean cloth and a beautiful posy of the roses that
grew round the lodge windows, in the middle! And after tea,
when everybody declared they really couldn't eat any more, how
Poppy did enjoy showing the children all over—besides the big
kitchen there was a back one where Mrs. Orchard did all the
cooking, so that the front room was as neat as a new pin always,
and up stairs there was a nice big bedroom and a cosy tiny one
out of it, which was to be Poppy's own when she was a big girl
and able to earn money to furnish it. Then the bit of garden was
a great source of pride, and a tiny wired-in poultry yard where
they could keep a few hens and have fresh eggs to sell and sometimes
to eat—all had to be shown, and the little guests took as much
interest in it as if it were their own.</p>

               <p>"To think of it all coming of Jack's and my having colds and
looking out of the nursery window to amuse ourselves! When
I saw you at the lodge yesterday afternoon, Poppy, I said to Delia
it was really like a story, didn't I, Delia? Do you ever make up
stories now, Poppy, about the mice, you know? How they must
miss you at number nine!"</p>
 
               <p>Poppy looked a little troubled.</p>
 
               <p>"Miss Bessie," she said, "I didn't make up about Flip and
the others. I might—p'r'aps I might have dreamed some of it, but
not all. I'd have told you, I would indeed, if I had made it all up."</p>

                        Bessie and Delia looked at each other and smiled.</p>

               <p>"Tell her, Delia, do," said Bessie. "Listen, Poppy."</p>

               <p>"It was about a dream I had," said Delia. "It was really very
funny. It was the night before we left London. Everything was
ready, all the trunks were packed—even a mouse might have had
the sense to see we were going away, so that part of it one
can understand. "Well, Poppy, I dreamt, or I didn't dream!—that
a little dark mouse with a very long tail—"</p>

"A tail with a twist at the end?" interrupted Poppy.</p>

               <p>"Yes-—I think so at least—well, he came on to my bed, I
saw him plain against the white counterpane, and stood there
quite still for a minute. Then I heard a little teeny voice say,
'Are you asleep, Miss Delia?' I was rather startled at first,
but I answered 'No,' for whether I was asleep or not, I thought
I was, you see. 'I beg your pardon,' he went on, 'for disturbing you
at this unseasonable hour—' he did use such grand words! — but my
excuse is that I may not have another opportunity. I see you are
all going down to the country—we ourselves have often thought
of taking a trip down there—we have cousins in the country,
but for several reasons we have given up thoughts of it—and no
doubt you will see our dear little friend, Poppy Orchard. May
I ask you to give her my very kindest regards—Flip—Flip Bright-
eyes is my name—and tell her we are all well, wonderfully well,
and comfortable. We have kept to our part of the bargain, and
you, Miss Delia, you and your kind Mamma have kept to yours.
No—no nameless one has so far disturbed our peace of mind."</p>

               <p>"'You mean we haven't any—' I was just going to say 'cat'
when I remembered that in Poppy's sto—I mean Bessie told
me that I mustn't say it to them—so I changed. 'I certainly will
never have any creature in the house who would hurt my birds,
and so, Mr. Flip, I think you are all pretty safe as long as you
all behave so well.' "He made a sort of twirl with his tail which
I think was instead of a bow.</p>

                        "'Thank you, thank you for the assurance,' he
said. 'We are grateful, we are indeed.
We never take anything we
have no right to—not even a
grain of bird-seed, unless it is
on the floor—we find crumbs
enough and to spare, thanks to
your Mamma's liberality. Tell
dear Poppy of our well-being
and—' I don't know what more he was going to say, for just then
mother came in with a candle to say good-night and off he
scampered. But any way, dream or no dream, I have given you
his message, Poppy."</p>
 
               <p>Poppy had been listening with all her ears.</p> 
               <p>"I am glad of it," she said, "for many a time I've thought of poor
Flip. Some day maybe, Miss Delia, I might have to go to help at
number nine—and then I'd see Flip again. I'm very pleased he
hasn't forgotten me."</p>
